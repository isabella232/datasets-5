﻿Fabio Berger + Remco Bloemen ,"0x - Decentralized exchange protocol. It is a set of smart contracts that handle standard transactions in an order format.
The key advantage here is that these smart contracts leads to shared liquidity
We also achieve increased security and network liquidity through our architecture.
We launched the network in August 2017.
It works, but is V1. We are working on V2 which helps people build hybrid stations, supports new token standards, and makes the contract more gas efficient.
V1 only allows humans to create orders; V2 will allow new smart contract to create orders. This is HUGE.
Notes:
We’re building the protocol; designing the standard; building dev tools for anyone to build a decentralized exchange.
Orders may become invalid for any reason:
Order being filled
Griefing attacks
We’ve now built an OrderWatcher that keeps relayers updated on the state of orders.
We’re using contract Events as a proxy for state changes.
Can do a diff between state trees and between block headers.
We also have a set of smart contracts to handle settlement;
Everyone who wants to trade is setting allowances on a smart contract.
We want upgradability.

Remix is there; but it’s not enough.
Tracing and profiling is not existent.
Remix does it, but can’t do it locally.
“Code coverage” tool exists but inserts console.logs in
Adding up gas costs per line of code.
Need to do profiling, because gas costs depend on inputs.
Solidity language itself:
Crashed the Solidity compiler twice today.
E.g. AbiEncoderV2 is pretty new and hard to understand/use.
The code that it produces is inefficient.
There is a stark stack limit in solidity
All the variables are locally scoped.
Un-intuitive as it is a curly braced language.
The lifecycle hook value_of is within a function.
Can only access top 16 slack slots. Including input and output.
We need to implement a graph coloring register allocator – to find out what the lifetime of the variables is.
“This stack slot was used in the first half –– the second half you can use”
Or implement register splitting.
Function inlining is frustrating sometimes:
E.g. SafeMath –– turns every operator into function call – which is a huge gas sink.
How Solidity optimizes could be improved:
It focuses on the code size (which makes sense since it’s minimizing the state tree); but sometimes you need to optimize size of tx gas (e.g. 0x needs optimized fillOrder call)
ABI doesn’t implement introspection
EIP 165
E.g. “does this contract implement ERC20, or ERC223?”
Solidity should have this in-built.
Should be built into the API spec and compiler.
Inheritance:
Interface or abstract contract – e.g. Solidity automatically creates getters for state functions –– collides with
Contract which implements an interface – public or external for abstract functions – they collide
ERCs – there is not a formal way to describe the interface for contracts.
Have a standard repo –– this will lead to a canonical ABI definition –– can have semantic rules around this. Could run some specific unit tests against

Want to add a formal verification tool to our deployment tool.
By analyzing the code, you can find patterns.

Make sure all functions have a “Read -> Write -> External Call” pattern, so you don’t have any race conditions.

State-watching –– built-in diff’ing of state trees
Should be implemented in the Ethereum clients – Geth and Rust.
They want this feature for OrderWatcher.
EIP process is suboptimal:
Lacks in consensus-building. There’s vocal people who don’t have good ideas; there’s a lot of noise.
To improve: committee-based approach (reputable stakeholders from reputable projects who get together?).
Problems are getting solved at the wrong abstraction level.
E.g. NFT standards.
Neufund was largest Solidity project before –– tokenized equity.
You want a EuroToken. You don’t want your company valuated in Ether.
What if blockchain forks; which token is actually tied to the company?
Bounty approach gives many different styles within the codebase.
This is a problem; e.g. OpenSSL codebase after Masters / PhDs.

Not reliable – can have race conditions;
Artifacts don’t allow you to have versions of the contract on different networks
You don’t run into this stuff if you’re just building a “hello world”
Overwriting parts of the contracts;
We rolled our own. It’s open-source but not documented. We have other things that are keeping us busy.
The problem is that Truffle has too much functionality –– we would like to see more of a Unix philosophy.
Cannot support different versions of Solidity.
Version management doesn’t exist.
EthPM –– doesn’t have versioning either? It’s going through a big refactor, so we held off. We need the NPM package manager.
We have built a lot of developer tools to interface with the smart contracts ourselves.
We have also built own deployer and migration tool, as truffle’s did not suit our needs.

Continuous Integration:

We just use testrpc.
Neufund was different than 0x:
Neufund was a trustee for tokens –– it was centralized by definition.
This made it simpler: I could create “open-ended” contracts –– a switch statement, that the default would send to another proxy contract.
But wouldn’t be able to do this with 0x –– e.g. if we wanted to add Shnorr signatures –– because it’s a governance / security issues.

Hard to debug and understand it all - so needed a smaller truffle for the specific use cases.
Need to standardise their artifact format (currently in talks about it).

One did not exist at the time. Did not have too much stuff in it really: simple formatting, definitions, highlighting. Not “a super interesting” project, but has 36 000 users (some duplicates).
VMs
Been wanting to speed up tests recently. Bottleneck is code execution in Ganache VM (90%). We want to get down to 1-10s test runs.
GAS PRICES ARE NOT THE SAME!!!! Arghhhhh!
We need JIT compilation in more performant language (currently just executed in JS).
Project called EthJIT VM, transpiles to LLL, then optimizes contract so that it is precompiled and then runs much faster.
Would be great to see the integrated in ganache (snapshots and time travel make this a nice tool than geth to use currently).
Even better to have pluggable VMs, have spoken to the Foundation about this too.

Quite hard with monetary prospects and no established legislation process - need better ways of governing and enforcing the process.
Really helped to have everyone in one room at ETHDenver and align on angles of attack.
Room at ETHDenver from commenting on a thread in GH. Started unstructured and moved into structured discussion by defining the interface, which helped identify all the different parties’ motivations. This revealed some inertia on some teams’ behalf, which was interesting to see.
Lot of discussions about metadata (of tokens, which is also important for other parts of tokens)
GH PRs are one single wall of text and the comments need to be better moderated, especially for trolls or tangential discussions/ideas (especially tangential ideas need to be collapsed).
Creators need to moderate/create a TL;DR section to help people better and more easily grasp what they are working on.
Solidity code coverage - how does that work?
Before each line calling eval, and modifying Eth and ganache code to read the events, much below the current block gas limit and working through everything that comes through.
Take debug transaction with list of opcodes. Also have the source maps, which map back from opcodes to lines of solidity code, and can use that the work backwards from opcodes to understand exactly which line used how much gas.
How do you get the trace after each tx?
We wrote our own provider, whenever call to eth_sendTransaction gone through provider it sends it and then gets the trace.
Calls don’t have traces though, so need to do a snapshot and then send the call as a tx, which gives you the trace back and then you can look at what happened in the call.
Did look at other tools, but felt the performance and reliability of those tools just kinda sucked.
Can you tell us more about Event Watching?
Lacking good open source project[a]
People don’t have stateful nodes, you need to handle events client side
Ethereum-js blockstream enables us to use stateless nodes after installing all filters. Still not a part of web3.
Working on something called order-watcher: track when the order becomes invalid. Which happens when the user manipulates things. You can validate reactively by watching for events, but you want to actually watch balance changes and events are just an imperfect proxy for this.
People can mint and burn tokens and change balance without emitting events.
Want to track changes in balances, not events. balanceOf() is view function that returns the balance, so we want to track the result of calling that.
Might be inefficient to look at that directly, or we can register callbacks and recompute only when the state used by that function changes.
But how do we know when state changes?
Cannot rely on solidity, but can run function, get trace, see which storage slots the function is reading, and then you for sure know that this function will only change its value when one of those storage slots changes.
Use Patricia tries somehow to watch these storage slots and state changes - allow you to watch efficiently changes on view and pure functions.
Check out EIP 781: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/781
Can you tell us more about ABI gen for statically typed contracts?
Contracts need to be checked at compile times to ensure parameters etc (strong instead of number or something like that) and being statically typed is much easier to check this.
Inspired by geth tooling, and there are also some JS ones (salt-size etc) but were all very opinionated and made all sorts of assumptions about how you wanted to use your contracts.
With 0x tool: Consensys is using it, Sybil (journalism tools, also with typescript contracts).
Using ethers.js for backend of contracts due to issues with web3 versions (classic).
Best ideas to have in a debugger?
Not writing solidity actively at the moment and I haven’t used one yet because it is such a high level tool (haha).
I feel that this is quite a long way away right now.
Need bytecode, source code, source maps, traces, interruptable VM etc.
Can you tell us more about signing data in Ethereum?
Arbitrary string that people were supposed to sign, but then people figured that you could use it to send ETH, hence the weird prefix that got implemented - not an EIP, it is just a bugfix.
If there is a way to display user data and get them to understand the transaction fully, then they would surely not sign. Prefix doesn’t solve anything, it just postpones the problem.

Most of their contracts don’t copy any code anymore.
","contracts, scalability, tokens, logic, deployment, javascript, gas, sanity checks, bounties","Ambisafe, Truffle","Our original vision was to do everything – testing, deployment, etc - through Truffle.
But, in reality, we’ve only used for testing.
First version of truffle was using the testrpc snapshots for reverting – good for unit testing.
In second, third versions this was removed.
Most companies use truffle for testing, on testrpc.
We made our own helper to make snapshots and do reverts on testrpc before/after tests.
Now, you can deploy the contracts from inside the tests; you’ll have a freshly deployed contract.
Truffle’s designed to be used by a single project –– a fixed set of contracts that doesn’t change much.
But most of our projects have different platforms, so we end up deploying different versions of our contracts over and over again.

﻿Brett Sun,"Working on Aragon entirely.
The end goal is to create a network between organisations that live on Ethereum (and potentially other platforms in the future).
This required a lot of foundational features.
A network of organisations requires organisations in the first place! So we have been working for the last year to build these.
We are now switching gears to think about what a network between the orgs will really look like.
We build aragon_os: an OS for organizations. We tend to think about resources (i.e. people and money), and structure the OS according to well-known principles. Instead of people and money, normal OSes manage CPU and RAM etc.
Two key pieces to this sort of work:
Controlling money.
Controlling permissions.
We also provide a lot of UI components on top of the contracts that we are writing.
The entire goal of 0.5 (live on Rinkeby now) is to allow people to easily create and manage their own organisation, along with granular permission and financial management.
Should be able to create their own application to live in their organisations: and this is where we imagine the network of organisations will emerge from.
Hooking up your own apps, and designing your own interfaces to handle certain complex behaviour
","netowkr, organisation, protocol, money, permissions, contracts, interfaces","Aragon, Ethereum","My biggest general frustration comes with the relative youth of the whole industry, which underlies a lot of our collective frustration, including both security and development.
It feels like we sometimes have our hands and feet tied when we are trying to make something. When you make a typical web app, there is a lot of freedom in tooling and the tooling is robust.
You can make changes easily, watch these changes propagate, feel productive, and get feedback immediately.
This is not the case on Ethereum - things that should take a day actually take a week or a month.
Estimation of time is really difficult, but especially in Ethereum given how many unknown unknown there are.
It’s really easy to get started, but it gets harder and harder to maintain.
Now that we have a lot of stuff built out, we now have to maintain it, and that decreases the rate at which we can ship new features as there is a lot of old architecture you need to deal with.
Feels like we’re playing a lot more defense than offence. Was first introduced to this by Jon Choi: you should be proactively pursuing offense and limiting defense (i.e. innovation over optimization).
All of these tools that are “not quite robust” tend to waterfall a lot, which means we are consistently on the defense, even against the tools we’re using.
No teams are really at the level of engineering that we need to be at. It’s all shooting from the hip right now, which we fall into too because we want to ship things quickly.
There are no really great patterns or best practices or frameworks to follow just yet, or at least a shortage of them in the ecosystem.
Every year in traditional ecosystems, a new testing framework will come out, which is really great and I would love to see a similar situation beginning to happen in the Ethereum world.

EVM and lower level stuff:
A lot of our problems have been solved by solidity 0.5 pragma
Revert with reason! Should be better for error logging.
Dynamically-sized parameters inside the EVM. We did not have an opcode before Byzantium that could have handled returndatasize with dynamically-sized stuff.
We play a lot with assembly and ABIEncoding has really bugged us before inside Solidity. So when, for eg, we want to stuff dynamic arrays with mock call data sent through delegatecalls. We have to do some funny business to properly encode them, and 0.5 exposes tooling to do this automatically.
Smart contracts:
Not a lot of great tools here yet, especially around testing. This seems to be a fairly obvious hole.
Not a big fan of Truffle, even though everyone seems to use it. It is especially slow when compiling.
Solc can be installed directly on most distros, and does stuff in less than 1s, whereas solcjs will take 20s, so why would you go for the latter?
Dapphub has their own set of nix-based tools that I haven’t tried yet, and really want to. But the barrier to understanding here if you don’t come from the right programming background is very high.
We use a bunch of standard libraries like Open Zeppelin, and the MiniMeToken and some other cool code that tends to fly around on GitHub or Reddit in the right places. However, this is a tricky place right now, because Package Management is unclear and no-one is yet sure if they want to use ETHPM.
There is a lot of people copy-paste contracts into their own repos, which isn’t great. It would be better to see them moved between repos with commit hashes and proper referencing.
We do this, as it is especially helpful for auditiability.
Dev tooling that allows people to easily build aragon applications:
It’s tough to develop Ethereum applications right because there are a lot of things you need to spin up yourself.
Deploy a local chain, deploy your contracts onto it, and then only with that done can you start building a UI linked to that chain.
Not too bad if you have just a few contracts, but with the way that Aragon has been designed (esp in term of flexibility) there are a lot of components that need to be deployed on chain before it all begins to work.
ENS on local chain, APM, base logic contracts, factories to extend the proxies on top of those basic contracts, and then only do we have a good chain state for people to hook up a UI against.
This produces a lot of friction, both internally and externally, so we have this goal to simplify it all.
Ganache has a snapshotting feature where it will dump the entire chain state (the whole patricia trie into a bunch of JSON files) that can then be used to start up your own chain from that state.
However, when you tell Ganache to run from the snapshot, if you do anything on the chain, it overwrites everything.
So you actually need two snapshots and some patience to get things right.
We also need to deploy things onto IPFS, which adds another barrier for users wanting to get going with local development.
So, we have tried to build this command into aragon-cli, called “aragon run” that handles everything for you.
Based on the brittleness of tooling though, it’s very difficult to make this reliable, and get it to error gracefully and debug why it isn’t working when it fails.
UI:
Not too much in terms of Ethereum-related tooling - a lot is just normal, front-end javascript.
Major frustration is web3.js. There are just so many things wrong with that package… “Every day is new adventure when using web3”.
Pretty much every time we have had to do something for a deadline, we have run into issue with it that have delayed us.
i.e. in Buenos Aires, we wanted a mainnet launch for our Survey App, for which we need websockets and https.
We set Parity up with secure websockets on our own node and launched our UI and web3 just doesn’t connect to secure websockets. So what was the problem?
Took some hours to play with all the different settings before realising that the latest version of web3 doesn’t support websockets. Downgrading then works, but the previous package didn’t have some other functions we needed.
Relied on getting events to process changed information in the UI. However, the event handler in one particular version of the package would send some events in the error callback as opposed to the actual one and we were totally baffled how that could even be.

We’ve built two different interpreters:
Language for ACLs
Language for tx descriptions, similar to Natspec.
Allows you to do calls to smart contracts; but really basic stuff;
Built generic framework for interacting with their contracts. Our dApp changes; needs to integrate with 3rd party apps without allowing dApp developer to touch the database.
Ruby on Rails abstraction on-top of the data layer.
Problem here: we don’t have any servers, we are a real dApp. Every single user has to compute entire state of the dApp.
Backend protocol / caching protocol / event-processing.
Upgradability stack.

Development cycle for Augur has been roughly three years - and mostly not development stuff. We had first working version of Augur on testnet after 4 months (been iterating since then).
It worked, but it didn’t scale and we found security problems. One can’t release software with bugs in it. So this weird balance needs to be kept as we cannot actually “move fast and break things”

Failed at random on different networks after working reliably against testrpc. It won’t tell you why and is deeply opaque. There is no error messaging and it is hard to use in general. The dependency of contracts gets very complicated (because logic is complicated).

  Stabilisation of contracts: we need clearly defined API’s against contracts.
When you change behaviours on a contract it has a multiplicative effect on the UI. One small change can have effect where you change 10 views. This lengthens dev cycles and having an API defined is important.
In general, it is hard to write business logic layer. Augur is writing a middleware node to overcome this.
Impractical to fetch large amounts of data from blockchain - it’s too slow. It takes a minute and half to get data (how do you manage that experience in the UI?). Running a remote geth node - fetching data from logs + contracts is not fast either. This can be improved.
Have an Augur node or SQL database -- pre-fetches and pre-processes Augur gnodes to make them available… But this also constitutes an annoying extra thing between ETH and client which can be slow / unusable.
Lookup mechanisms are primitive!
Size limit on contracts is really annoying -- can’t deploy to Ropsten because of it. It took significant engineering to put something on testnet (had to 51% attack it to increase block size).
Getting TestNet eth is hard ---  not a way to get a good amount of rinkeby (can only get a little bit from faucet -- don’t want people spamming it with transactions)
Really intense test suites running against Ropsten (Raiden…)
Would be great if we could easily spin up private chain to deal with that. Build a service to spin up private test nest that would have a certain amount of nodes.
Currently, this takes days of work -- what about standard service to do this?? People run these in different setting -- EC2 that is configured would be very useful..  Could store copies of Rinkeby and boot them up when people ask for them…  (Infura will evolve into this)
What would be the hardest part of teaching your Mom how to use a dapp?
How ETH account is different than an account on a regular website.
Few ways to login to Augur -- can create an account on the website, but you have to keep track of it (like creating an account on the website).
Airbit will create accounts for Augur that will behave like regular website.

Lack of modularity is the biggest problem (across all tools listed below). Building on top of, rather than within, the EVM you need to update the toolset you’re using and this becomes really difficult with the current tools.
If you implement some different opcodes in solidity, you need to take them all the way up. Open source is great, but it needs to be easy to fork and re-implement it easily in order for it to be really powerful.
Talk to person who had to modularise Truffle internally (not just testing, but also the lack of modularity - if you want to change something and still talk to others in the space, the best solution is often to rewrite the whole tool yourself, which is less than ideal). Aidan to send intro to David about this.
Parity and Geth
Also speak with David and Greg.
Use Parity due to responsiveness from the community and how good they are at answering questions!!! Great community - so NB!! Aidan’s biggest asset is his network of core community members, which really matters in decentralized communities - open channels of communication.
Rust is a more obscure language and people lack experience, hence geth is somewhat easier to use and troubleshoot.
Geth has a bigger community, but the actual people developing the client aren’t as readily available as Parity.
MetaMask for frontend development
Were tasked with making MM work for client and had to rebuild a lot of the stuff. Will also send an intro to the dev who handled. Greg is his name.
Mythril
Huge frustrations with this tool. Getting it running is a pain in the ass.
If it could be applied at the stack layer and not the smart contract layer. Build something like Mythril for an EVM implementation, trace things up the stack cleanly, add/remove opcodes, make new instructions. A stack explorer so to speak.
Could spawn so many things because we could understand the stack in a better way and grab a lot more logic. Pity to see focus on higher level tools, which has become somewhat of a hindrance. Why hyperledger went out and did it themselves (not just the licensing issues).
Educational tool for stupid web devs like me to learn about how opcodes actually work and are composed in the EVM.
Regular rust and node related stuff (also some go stuff).
Are there tools from these arenas that don’t exist in Ethereum which would be really cool?
We need to make these tools more closely aligned with the chain itself. With WASM coming online, this is already happening and we just need to be ready - i.e. teach everyone WASM.
The end if here for really high-level development with WASM. What this will mean for the community and internet in general has yet to be discussed completely.
Try to use ethers.js as much as possible as opposed to web3
The person developing these tools (Richard) is totally accessible, responds to issues immediately (faster than a bot!!) - he is so collaborative and wants to make sure everyone is using the best tools possible, and this all makes such a difference.
Polymath people doing off-chain signing, which you couldn’t do at the time and 1 of the methods didn’t have a response variable they needed, and by the next morning it was updated. Tight feedback loops make it so much better to use tools.
You can create your own wallet in 4 LOC in your terminal - again the language and syntax is so much easier for a non-dev that this solution ought to win in the long time. Very relatable and understandable code base.
Gave solidity and parity/EVM workshops:
EVM workshop: took instructions, showed how it would be passed onto stack, where things go, how it gets passed on to memory. Questions were so relevant and knowledgeable.
Whereas in the solidity workshop, the questions were much more absurd and irrelevant. Talking about the stack, people from a dev background get it. It just makes sense. Take away: if we want devs who have been developing for 20 years, we need to actually show them how the stack works.
This is a community-wide failure that we need to focus on - for someone with a CompSci degree, solidity is crazy, but the stack is not!!

The C version is very fast - but if you run the emscripten version, it’s painfully slow.  In transpiling process of C++ version, it drops down performance. The JS transpile needs to be improved.
Solc compiler slows down development time. Ideal to stay in local JS (and not have to go back to solc), have it compiled super fast inline using a tagged template literal or something like it (using require(“solc-inline”) or equivalent).
Could write `solidity` in backticks and have it compiled all in same file.

﻿Goncalo Sa,"I work at Consensys Diligence - focus on security of the ecosystem. Everything that is related to security: it’s on our roadmap to tackle it.
95% of our work today consists in doing security audits on smart contracts - any EVM-compatible or “compilable” code. That accounts for building security tools that do the checks automatically, or that assist on manual inspection.
The goal is to eventually encompass everything related to Ethereum security.
I have always been hacking - a grey hat of sorts.
Built an ad tech startup, which had a built from scratch ad server that I did the architecture for.
Had a mobile app to tell Portuguese people what was happening in their city.
","security, ecosystem, audit, compile, automatic, manual","Consensys, EVM","I really, really want a good visual debugger. I don’t think I’m alone on this one either, but I also don’t think people are as passionate about this as I am.
My main motivation behind this is that I really like visual debugging and it is just so much easier, when debugging a very low level program, to have a visual aide.
It requires real experience to reason about things at a very low level and see the effect of each line of code.
Remix, right now, has a very steep learning curve and we are missing the opportunity to make sure that every developer coming in gets clear insight into the nitty gritty details, the fine print, of the EVM that actually gives them full control over what they are doing and what they want to do.
I feel that very contained environments are usually more appealing to people just entering the world of computers and programming.
When Apple started with Swift playgrounds and lots of integrations, I saw a bunch of people just flocking into iOS development. It was just so easy to understand what is happening - it’s all very visual and easy to grok.
","debugger, visualisation, ","Remix, EVM, Apple, Swift","A proper, local dummy client. I love the Truffle team and I love Ganache, which I use a lot.
I run a lot of tesst on Ganache, which are not seamless to run on other machines, so I would love a super seamless cross-platform client that has a great block explorer in it.
Using the visual version of Ganache about a month ago, I couldn’t see events being fired, or various important details on transactions happening there. We need a more full-fledged local client.
We haven’t really prepared for how to handle contracts across shards (coming months to years, who knows?).
We are looking mostly at tools to support the WASM architecture. This is likely the problem that will take the most of our time, I think. I have talked to Johan Barbie about this and I’m not sure anyone has a very good solution for what a tool that would help scheme the interactions out actually looks like.
I am personally more worried about language design stuff, and languages in general, than I am about the consensus layer, or anything below the language and application layer.
We are also working hard on updating our tools to support, for instance, Vyper. John has been doing a terrific job there, doing contract translations from Solidity to Vyper, built a plugin for Truffle.
Mythril will also eWASM at some point before it goes into production.
","local client, visualisation, transactions, contracts, sharding, language, design, consensus","Ganache, eWASM, Vyper, Mythril, Solidity","I do this less frequently now, but I basically watch every interesting repo to know what they are doing next before any announcement or anything.
I also spend a lot of time reading the docs in that repo. In fact, a couple years back, I would spend most of my time reading those kind of docs.
Also, the Ethereum wiki has a lot of super involved stuff that is not easy to grasp and there should be somewhere where those things are explained far more simply.
Again, I’m a very visual guy, and that wiki really lacks graphics and images that could be really helpful in terms of giving a wider group of people insight into the innards of the systems.
Things like RLP encoding, Patricia-Merkle tries, or the ABI sender (which I went back to over and over again until eventually getting to a sort of Eureka moment re encoding reference types). I feel like the tries, in particular, are very visual things.
RLP graphic resources would really help because it is such a specific thing.
The Beige Paper is awesome, but it’s still not the end game - it’s too technical still with almost no visual guidance still requires a very big leap for people dealing with blockchain for the first time.
","visualisation, RLP, ABI, beige paper",Ethereum,,,,,,,,,,"None come to mind right now. Let’s keep the focus on EthPM here - we need to make sure as many people use it as possible! We should have done this a long time ago and we need to dogfood it as a community!

Use it as a text editor, in fact, but mostly for debugger when I am auditing, especially when trying to prove/disprove an attack I have thought up.
Visual debugging feature helps me a lot. It’s not perfect, though.
We’re fans of dogfooding, so I use Mythril a lot, which was initially created by Bernard, but is now being developed by a bunch of people we hired.
Used mostly for automatic detection of errors.
Oyente is falling behind a bit, so I haven’t used it in a long time.
Manticore is not built by us and does the same thing as Mythril (we have compared it). Though the inner workings are very different, the result is largely similar.
Have played with, but never tried to integrate, Enchidna into my workflow, as it is difficult to work with due largely to deadlines.
Rattle is closed source, so haven’t yet got around to playing with it.
I extended a tool from Federico, who has an ANTLR parser for solidity, that is basically a viz and query tool for solidity contracts.

",,"Remix, Surya, Mythril, Truffle","What are the details/patterns in smart contract audits you see often that people should not be writing?
People are lacking the granular insight that is required - along with the right mindset/philosophy/paradigmatic approach to writing smart contracts. This goes back to the need for better visual tools, in my opinion.
A lot of contracts do not acknowledge that they are operating in a resource-constrained environment. For instance, I see lots of loops - which is not a desirable thing when operating on top of Ethereum.
People also don’t have that “asynchronous mindset”, unless you have been working with a very strange stack indeed. Even people coming from JS and pure node backgrounds - it’s not quite the same thing.
They keep favouring push mechanism when there should be a pull one (or vice versa).
In reality, this is a very hard question. I do have a collection of very specific stuff I have seen people do wrong, but - in a very general manner - the biggest problem is bringing synchronous patterns into smart contracts.
Thinking of a way to have them do otherwise, this whole thing is promoted by people not getting what is actually happening beneath their code. They know it is “distributed”, but what does that mean to them? Hence the need for something like a Swift playground in order to make it easier to grasp the use of resources on the network

Data analytics and reconciliation btw on-chain and off-chain data.
Our first MVP didn’t have a back-end at all but we had to develop a back-end as we scaled. Reconciling these quickly and correctly is key.
Analytics is difficult. Web3 and Geth, have to hook into data. But there are too many hurdles to jump to get these.
In particular, the biggest problem is when we want to deal with analytics where some of the data is implicit, like a series of transactions. One tx doesnt give enough data. When someone bids on a sale option in cryptokitties, bidder, price, and catId. Have those 3 pieces of information. But when you ask how many cats has this person sold? This info is implicit in a wider set of tx’s, all of which you have to fetch and then compare..
Part of this is not them including this info in advance. A common problem in the ecosystem is that once you deploy something you need more info after deploying a smart contract and it’s hard to get this

Piper’s python tools
(would like to see C++)
Maker’s bash tools
Some dapphub Haskell tools
EF should put money into language ecosystems; replicate what we have (more front-end library systems!)
Second layer tools - the Ethereum API is a huge pain point.

Small drop in solutions for talking to a client
Why is there not a good robust solution for caching the blockchain in a normal database?
Maker has funded this.
VulcanizeDB done by Rick Dudley; Maker is funding
When you talk to Infura, the Ethereum API, is mostly via HTTP. Need sockets.
If you want to query events, it’ll probably time out.
It will be cool if EF runs archive nodes, cached data.
Feels bad about Metamask:
If you only used them to write to blockchain, then it would be so much simpler for them.
Metamask just pipes all the requests to Infura; costs around 100k a month.
The reason why everyone uses Metamask, is because there’s no other robust solution. If EF funded a solution, it’ll be helpful
Metamask is customer support for the entire Ethereum ecosystem.
Event querying
Make it so that it’s not scanning for the whole blockchain.
Light clients
Everyone’s trying to build the perfect architecture. Metamask is trying to build something that works.
Metamask’s version:
An awesome intermediate step:
Infura publishes a block onto IPFS using pubsub
All the metamask nodes gossip it to each other.
Could EF support this.
There is someone publishing all blocks from all blockchains on IPFS, into a meta-blockchain, called Braid.
Whisper & Swarm:
There’s other people still working on these outside of ETH
Swarm is similar to IPFS.
Does ETH need p2p messaging
There’s systems that work:
DAT protocol / secure scuttlebut (1,000s of people on these networks)
Ask the Secure Scuttlebut ecosystem what their issues are
Dfinity gave a grant to secure scuttlebut
It would improve the Ethereum community image if we’re working with others.

﻿Esteban Ordano,"I’m hiring two or three people – excellent engineers – to build tooling.
We’re calling the project Voltaire Labs, after the Voltaire house. Trying to get Sergio Lerner to help with that. Getting people I know from Google. Maybe we should join efforts? Will intro to Federico Bond.
Our infra:
MANA token which is an ERC20.
Auction of Land.
Land smart contract which is an NFT token standard.
Got tired of not hearing back re ERC non-fungibles improvements. Proposed alternative ERC.
Land registry of who owns which land parcel.
These link to IPFS or IPNS for content of land.
Decentralized exchange of land parcels.
Small tool for sending emails whenever an event is triggered on your contract. EthAlarm: takes address of contract, ABI, pick events that you’re interested in.
We run the land auction off-chain, we had a period of registration where you’d send the MANA you wanted to use in the auction. At the end of the auction, we distributed the NFT tokens and returned MANA.
Auction was mostly an independent application – better UX, less fees
Why the auction was off-chain:
We processed around 115k bids. The UX for the auction was great. We managed to provide the user with an experience that was way better, because it wasn’t blockchain-based.
Both on the browser and the server, we exchanged cryptographic receipts –– “I’d like to bid for the following parcel (x,y), (x,y) – at the end you’d receive a signed receipt” – the server would receive that message, and say back “I’ve received a bid, and here’s your receipt”. All these receipts are public.
Anyone in the auction everyone could act as an independent verifier of the auction.
We returned a receipt had a nonce ––
We can audit the whole auction. Can prove every bid that we received.
How we’ve been running auditing
We sold $16m worth of parcels of land.
We wanted to make sure that they weren’t messing up.
Not many people were checking – but a few did and even reported back some issues; community trusted them.
Would be best if this was run on a decentralized protocol so people didn’t have to trust these guys.
We’re building a voting scheme with MANA:
“How tall should this building be?”
We are repeating the same pattern as the auction.
Our voting scheme is offchain and non-binding, because the project is early enough that people can back out.

The gas issues – the expensiveness of the whole process.
We are subsidizing the whole process of deploying the land.
We are also subsidizing the second transaction after the ERC is assigned.
This whole process will take 12 million, 150 ETH.
We also had to make the contract upgradable – with the delegate proxy pattern
We are worried that Solidity will change, and the structure of storage will change.
Our thinking: we’re doing some engineering on how to sell the next batch of land – we came up with a better system to sell that land – it’s going to be pretty neat. We’re not going to have this issue.

Browsing through a node that has a huge list of unindexed transactions without all the information you need in an easily accessible place is hard.
With our own tools, we are building our own framework in order to move tx information from the blockchain to the db and from the db to the app.
We need transformations between each layer (which wasn’t that hard to build). But now we need a really generic way to do this and to publish it for people building DApps and using our SDK. And with a centralised DB, this is not possible.
We are failing with dev tools in general.
Let’s think about Java a bit. You have the JVM, a mature language and a complete set of IDEs. You also have a tonne of framework for building Java applications. There are also great monitoring tools.
Logging systems are a great and practical example of this. How can I log failures from Solidity without using events in a way which they weren’t really intended to be used? We need a Splunk equivalent.
Terraform, AppDynamics, etc - these things don’t exist for blockchains and really need to be built.

One of team members rewrote web3 into typescript for EthBuenosAires and all the tests are passing! Will post a link here after the hackathon.
There were typos there!
There was functionality not working (and there are billions of $’s running on top of it!)
IPFS for decentralized deployments.
Scalability is a concern here. If we want to deploy the whole metaverse in IPFS, we actually can’t. We need to replicate data in, I don’t know, Amazon or something because we can’t supply the level of connection we need to (just 100,000 users or so, not even in the millions). And even this will require bootstrapping nodes like crazy.
The IPFS cluster is still in alpha and not as stable as we need it to be.
We are waiting for scalability, but we don’t have the tools to monitor and handle that amount of information anyway, and this is a concern for us.

How we solved: created a single issue with all comments from other issues. Created google form for anyone who had an issue, to see if there’s a pattern amongst problems.

Started with building dApps, contracts, UIs – everything was broken in 2015.
Then jumped into proposing things and fixing things;
Solidity
Testing
Javascript
Led to working on testrpc & ganache-core
Worked on Trezor, and build a dApp for it.
Ended up with all these other issues: cpp-ethereum; testrpc; RPC methods.
Tried to raise issues, and sometimes they end up in improvements.
Spends most of his time in Solidity design.
eWASM – started 3 years ago for 6 months – then took a big break – then now working on it for 3-4 months (really started in Jan).
","experimentation, optimise, dapps, UI, C++, RPC, javascript, contracts","Solidity, EVM, Trezor, eWASM, Testrpc, Ganache","Communication is bad within EF and within ecosystem in general
People aren’t aware of existing products / solutions
Duplicate effort solving the same problems
Not everyone agrees on the same communication channels –
People use different tools
Seems to be fixed now with Gitter.
Lack of resources
People jumping across projects
Workflow on EVM / eWASM – problems (below):
Axic: Review process
On Solidity – we’ve grown 200%
Some people are remote; a lot are part-time
There’s a lot of onboarding
Because of onboarding – not everyone’s review is equal, takes some people with experience and insight.
It’s very easy to block people
Github Projects kinda helped this process:
Organize features into versions.
They had a label for breaking changes;
Should be clear from the PR list.
Backlog is really large and growing. There’s too much that we don’t have enough time to get setup project management process.
For every PR, someone has to learn all the subsystems that are involved. Solidity is a big codebase.
It’s a complicated codebase; needs refactoring
Three ways of generating bytecode from AST:
Way 1: cpp stream of instructions, values, and comments
Way 2: append inline assembly
Way 3: compile Julia into bytecode
Our focus is moving to Julia, and using that to generate bytecode.
We’ve planned a full rewrite of the “code generator” subsection.
But they found a way to do it without a full rewrite.
Julia:
Has an internal AST, a parser, a syntax for the parser.
Backends: which generate bytecode from the AST->EVM, EVM15, eWASM.
Transformation steps: things that happen on the AST; could be built independently.
These exist for EVM and EVM15.
Building these for eWASM could be a task.
But they’re good on-boarding work for new contributors.
The external static analyzer:
Written in Javascript.
Currently part of Remix.
Try to use a number of options that the compiler gives you.
There’s no option to turn off warnings.
Therefore: anything there is a warning, you should fix it.
Delegating warning generation for things that are conventions to this external static analyzer.
Two major things to be done for bounties re the static analyzer:
Bounty #1) Separate it from Remix, and make it independent.
Bounty #2) It uses the old AST format, that the compiler used to generate.
In other words: the compiler parses, creates an AST (which is a big JSON object), which is then passed to the static analyzer
The new AST JSON is much more compact –– but means that the static analyzer should be written.
This could be more iterative.
Mist has this notion that it has Solidity compilation built-in.
Considers “warnings” and “errors” the same –– so throws.
The homepage has 1) old Solidity examples (which has errors), 2) recommends Mist (which throws errors for warnings).
Pawel:
Making cpp-ethereum more modular.
Started removing some parts, and moving it to different repos.
Two things:
A Proxy for JSON RPC.
Maybe should write the Proxy in Go.
What it is:
Previously, we had 1) an HTTP server to handle the requests, and 2) some Unix sockets to handle other incoming requests.
The HTTP server is replaced by a simple Python script. Replaced the HTTP requests with a Unix socket requests, so same underlying system can be used.
There’s no reason for implementing all the transport layers in each client.
This Python script only exists in cpp-ethereum, but should be included in other clients.
Only complaint about Python: it’s hard to ship an executable object of code.
A proxy for the p2p network stack
Same as above, but for the networking layer.
E.g. devp2p or libp2p protocols.
Your application protocol (e.g. Ethereum or Swarm) connects to a new p2p layer.
We should instead use the same p2p layer.
Problem: duplicated effort of implementing the same things.
Need a nice interface for inter-process communication.
Can combine different parts of the stack in different languages.
EVM-C: C interface for EVM.
Should stay under Pawel’s control.
Potential bounties: create EVM-C bindings for different languages.
E.g. Python, Go.
Could be useful to have a fast EVM implementation;
Same idea for eWASM:
Use the same interface within go-ethereum to hook in eWASM.

","design, language, formal verification, research, scalability","Plasma, STARKs, SNARKs, Solidity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gas profiling:
Solidity does some upper-bound gas cost estimation – but its not very useful because it’s just an upper bound.
How to calculate: run the EVM with specific inputs?
Or: run the function with larger and larger arrays; and find a “gas function” as a function of input size. But this also depends on state.
Solidity – 16 stack slots issue:
Soon: we’ll have structs, and this will be less of an issue.
When we have IULIA, this requirement will go away.
When IULIA compiles to EVM, it can move variables from stack to memory, after analyzing which is used or not.
Interesting: IULIA will compile to eWASM.
Inlining common function calls:
We’re conservative when it comes to adding new features in the code generation flow.
We already have an optimizer for IULIA which does inlining; so that will resolve this.
The optimizer (in solc) has a switch which decides what to optimize for: code size, execution cost.
This exists, but is rather crude – it assumes every opcode is only run once and this assumption breaks down if you have a loop.
Have Remco share his 0x example with Christian – and how it could be improved in terms of gas estimation.
Constant delegation.
Have Remco to share example of hash not being calculated at compile-time.
Having a good technical writer – who can understand the technical details of Ethereum, and improve the documentation.
Another model could be to create bounties for improving the documentation. Won’t be bounties for a specific issue; but general rewards for improvements to the documentation.
Improving the documentation for Solidity
They’re too deep inside this. Having an external viewpoint would be helpful.
In the research area: due to the way research funding works – people publish the work, but do no maintain the software or integrate with other tools.
Integrating research software with development tooling & keeping them up to date.
Big example: Formal Verification software
Five or six tools that similar to Oyente.
Remix has a plugin architecture – possibly supports Oyente.
Idea for tool: being able to test very quickly if a contract implements an interface.
The problem is that you cannot enumerate the functions of a contract.
There’s a way to resolve this.

Need help there, and can pay $ for it.
Why they haven’t focused on getting more people, is the project management burden there.
What kind of help we need:
Implementation.
The project is a compiler that takes a high-level language, turns it into an arithmetic circuit. It’s PoC stage right now. Also needs help with the direction the project needs to go. Needs an evaluation of use-cases.
Also needs people with cryptography backgrounds who can implement efficient arithmetic circuit gadgets.
Someone who can deal with Rust as a language; finite-fields.
Open-source on Github.
Potential help: university research partners –– Dan Boneh?
It’s early, PoC stage. –– currently the elliptic curve pre-compiles are too pricy.
The first step is to see how much it costs, and if it’s feasible because of this.
Analyze use-cases, and see whether its not too expensive.
Improve the trusted setup experience.
Solidity?
Development resources: we’re pretty much good right now.
We have issues marked: “good first task” or “help needed” – these are good to pick up by external contributors. They’re small in scope, so maybe doesn’t make sense for large bounties.
Usually someone creates a PR, we have comments, they update the PR, we make comments, then the contributor loses interest.
Maybe: could have a person who is responsible for external contribution across all projects?
Another project: analyze external contributions, and understand why they weren’t completed. What was missing in the description / what was the issue? If you’re creating an issue for external contributors, what is the detail / info you need so it gets picked up.
Where we need help:
External people to translate the documentation.
This is a big effort. Requires management. Need to keep translation up to date.
This doesn’t really exist right now. Only have a Russian / Spanish translation that are old and rudimentary.
There’s people to do the translation –– need someone to do the project management.
More feedback from people who try out the most recent version of Solidity before it is released.
Before – Remix was set to the most recent development snapshot. Now it’s set to latest stable, so don’t get immediate feedback.
Truffle and etc only upgrade manually – so its more stable – but slows down the feedback / dev cycle.
How would this work:
“Reminder: people please try out new versions.”
Way to give feedback exists: creating an issue on Github OR their Gitter channel.
Most people can’t use the latest the version – because the toolset doesn’t allow it.
As part of the CI, we’re running some tests with specific libraries.
Possible solution:
People submit their contracts to Solidity team.
They get integrated into their CI pipeline – every time a new version is pushed, their contract tests are run.
We get contacted if tests pass re new version working.
Tools for developing Solidity
It’s written in cpp, we usually cmake toolchain for building, cpp-ethereum for semantic tests; thinking about switching to their own interpreter to speed up tests.
Uses cpp-ethereum with a few extra RPC endpoints. Let’s you rewind the blockchain to a particular block. It’s also allows you to modify the timestamp in the next block.
They’re standardizing these API endpoints. -> include ganache-cli in these discussions?
Ganache needs to have this ability.
Having a testing only Ethereum blockchain
Has a memory-only blockchain; is mainly meant to run tests on smart contracts.
Similar to ganache; but performance could be improved?
Ganache has a UI
To improve: high-throughput, many txes at once.
Notes on IULIA:
Compilation from IULIA to EVM is finished.
Optimizer is 90% finished.
This is why the ABIcoder isn’t out yet, because it depends on the optimizer.

Initially, it was built by Jeffrey Wilke.
Then Marek was working on it. Then I joined.
After Marek left, I took over. I’ve been on it on my own for the last and a half year.
Did a full refactor. I changed everything to be more intuitive, simple, how I thought it should be.
Changed to a Pub/Sub model – can currently subscribe for logs, transactions, block headers. In the future, you should be able to subscribe to state changes, account balance changes, or anything else.
It’s harder now to make global changes across Ethereum – because of different clients, agreements take time
E.g. Parity has the Pub/Sub model, and a parity-Pub/Sub model.
A lot of work around promises resolving based on conditions

Are you running into problems with any of the following:
Gas limit: Totally. If you don’t properly separate your contracts or import too many, the gas limit blocks you. Especially on Ropsten with a dynamic gas limit, this doesn’t work.

﻿Martin Swende,"I was a security professional, doing consulting, came into Ethereum a couple of years ago solving bounties for VMs.
October 2016 - became Head of Security at The Foundation.
Monitoring mainnet.
Being able to react when there is a consensus flaw. Had an API call to geth, called getBadBlocks. Geth will save bad blocks and you can query node for it.
So, we run geth and parity simultaneously. Ask parity node for last block, ask geth for bad blocks, If they match, can see more easily why and who might have acted badly.
But can’t do it vice versa - been nagging Parity to add that end point so we can do the same process in reverse.
Geth client has a lot of metrics: how many i/o connections, db writes, block processing times, peer connects. Can export from geth and display in any charting you like. So, that’s exactly what we do; get nice graphs about tx churn, how txes were rejected, queued, pooled.
Optimizations in geth which made block processing faster in the past month. You can also monitor for performance, not just security...
Shanghai attacks taught us that performance very much related to security.
P2P network information, protocol dissector / analyzer -- if I can see what is happening on my node and what my peer capabilities are, what have they seen, etc.  Is there any one peer that is sending me transactions that I reject? That way, I can identify bad behaving or lying peers (more in-depth view of what people are telling me over the network)
Would be difficult as an add-on (need node keys, decrypt data, etc.),  Much simpler to do within a client.  Protocol layer in Geth.
Build tools for analysis, especially when things are going wrong: hacks, network problems.
E.g. transaction propagation when network was overloaded with txes going back & forth between parity and Geth.
Needs for lots of testing around hard forks as the existing tools were not sufficient to cover all cases.
Coverage guided fuzzing - generate code and run on instrumented version of Geth / Parity. This matches code coverage, generates new code and increases coverage using fuzz tactics to mutate inputs and can test geth and parity differentially. Do they have the exact same stuff in the stack, in memory etc.?
Another fuzz testing tool based on EVM Lab that can generate tests for CPP ethereum and can cover py-ethereum etc by running in docker container with a switch that enables an output after every opcode and compare internal state differentially again. Run this 24/7.
Caught 5-6 consensus issues with this. Last hard fork was a controversy as Parity had done a whole bunch of releases prior to the hardfork and the suggestion was to postpone, which would have caused its own issues and forced clients to update again.
If patched before hard fork - no problem. Beat the drums and tell everyone to upgrade.
If you find a consensus issue on an existing client it is a bit more problematic.Telling everyone means giving people the chance to exploit it - tough to handle.
Examples of consensus issues: make a tx which invokes a precompile like verify_signature and if that, in one case returns true and in another returns false, or if they cost different amounts of gas (i.e. x on geth and y on parity) then post-state will be different so they won’t accept the same blocks and then we have a fork.
There was a consensus issue that happened after Spurious Dragon when we implemented state cleaning. Chain split for 200 blocks, which were created on the wrong chain that were then abandoned. Block 2 600 000 or so.
Developers need to be alerted as soon as possible so they can fix it ASAP. People can lose money in the meantime, txes can be reverted. All exchanges need to be alerted to hold deposits and withdrawals.
Have built tools to detect this, so we consider it solved from a technical p.o.v.
Recommend that exchanges run all clients, but not sure if they do. Could be standardised with docker containers that could be more streamlined. Documentation around best practices, automated tooling etc.
Building something like Ethstats but more detailed. If there is a consensus failure, you might want to see exactly which tx in which block caused it. Nice to see blocks, txes and intermediate root hashes between each tx. Then you can see different post-state hash, i.e. that is where we should start looking.
Need detailed traces of exactly what happened in every opcode of this transaction.
One of the things I built in EVM Lab is a reproducer. Synthesises pre-state for that particular tx, then executes it and gives you a detailed trace from geth and parity that you can then compare.
Not much active development on EVM Lab. Use it mainly for investigating certain condition or opcode or potential attack. Pretty easy to put together desired scenario in an EVM assembly-like way by setting genesis you want and then run & benchmark it.
It is usable right now and I have no immediate plans to do anything in the near term. Might need some updates and it is not so user friendly.[a]
One of core devs for go-ethereum.
We want to expand - have 2 interns now, but had to turn someone away recently too. Send interested developers to Peter.
Working a lot with the signer, which was just merged in latest release. Standalone binary which can run off some secure enclave, USB armoury, parallel VM, some other machine on your network. Can be used for offline signing and has trusted UI.
Can be configured with particular rules written i.e. in JS. Definitely needs more work on the UI. has implemented one in python-qt and python-cleft. Can also be run in a console, with remote ports etc so you can decouple pvt keys from your daily computer.
Hoping MetaMask will integrate with it directly. Has spoken with Dan and another guy called Jordan building a tool called (?) which has integrated it already.
Hard problem: how to make it more secure for end users. Surf internet with unpatched browsers with 0 days and they get exploited. How can we improve upon that so that you have a sign what you see flow. Submit a tx, see the details of that tx when you approve it.
Unlock feature is most horrible thing he has seen where it will sign every tx sent to it for a given period.

Abstracting – one key-value contract that stores pointers to data.
Rest of data – stores all data. Mappings of hashes to boolean to structs / addresses / etc.
Leads to upgradability of contracts. To the parameters used in the logic.

I’m a bit skeptical of formal verification stuff, but I think it’s important to keep pushing it forward.
Do more audits.
Write defensive code. Don’t try to do crazy things.
For the first time, we’re mixing two things that haven’t been mixed together:
The two:
Critical code – contracts holds money.
Open-source – everyone can see how it works.
E.g. you don’t have this in planes – critical program but not open-source.
E.g. in a website – it could be open-source but not critical.
So you realize you need to write perfect code, but that’s not possible. Because code is written by humans.
It’s important to improve:
Do not take risks.
Try to isolate the critical part. E.g. if you’re doing an ICO, don’t hold the ETH in the contract, instead put it directly into the multisig.
Minimize the box, with its known security vectors.
On one side, you have a blockchain that by definition that is immutable. On the other side, immutable is not compatible with making mistakes.
Humans make mistakes. We are building things on top of that immutable base that could have mistakes.
But we need to keep blockchains immutable, because if don’t, we lose their power.
How do we solve this?
Possible approach is having a second layer –– instead of ETH, we use an ETHToken. ETHToken has governance built in and can be modified. You build it in a more centralized manner, it can be changed; and then overtime, you soften the centralization rules, and make it decentralized (take away the authority, make it operated by a DAO, etc).
E.g. having an escape hatch would be super helpful. If there is a hack, it could be sent to the EF or whitehat group. And then you can decide what to do. Better than it going directly to a hacker.
And then you can build the smart contract applications on this second layer.
Want to make decentralization linear; so you don’t have to take the risks from the beginning.
All contracts in Giveth have escape hatches built in.
STANDARD LIBRARY for using ETHToken in your contract, layer for security, escape hatches => I think it might be a bit too early though since we’re still figuring it all out. Other teams working on this include Zeppelin, Aragon.
Better compilers. Better testers. Better formal verification. All the tooling helps.

before we can really go mainstream:
Scalability.
Security.
Usability
Seems like security is as much an education problem, as tooling. Any ideas how we should approach this?
Documentation helps.
Realize that you will spend proportion of 40-to-1 on testing/auditing your contract vs writing.
Team audits
Doing an audit within your team.
Once you’ve done your personal work on the smart contract, and you’ve done your own audit; then get together with your team, and start talking about your concerns, and you’ll see that one idea leads to another, and you discover issues.
Audits
Write some small bugs in the code, and see if the code reviewers find that bug.
Even if the auditor knows that there are bugs, they will be forced to go deeper into the code.
Bug bounties.
I was skeptical of these at first. Why would people review this code?
But I have seen personally over the last year that big security holes have been discovered in bug bounties.
Bug bounties force you to write very good code.
You need to choose the right names for variables, document it, it needs to be understandable.
Good resource: Consensys, on the history of all bugs. https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices
This wiki could be complemented with these more generic ideas – around bug bounties, reference smart contracts etc.

﻿Stefan George,"CTO of Gnosis and is building a prediction market, ddex and smart contract wallets.
Started in 2013 - discovered that we could add prediction markets using btc escrow because that was missing (a p2p marketplace for predictions).
Joe Lubin convinced us in 2015 to start a formal platform based on Ethereum, did the token launch and spun out of Consensus and begin working on the more fundamental problems
Decentralized exchanges!! But not efficient on Ethereum today (scalability and number of participants). We have had to contribute to building the DDEX infrastructure.
Prediction markets are a way to create new ERC20 tokens (conditional payment/purchase). The value of those tokens is only defined at a certain point in the future. We can therefore create derivatives of other ERC20 tokens, which are more precise investments under certain conditions.
DDEX allows people to trade the efficiently. It can be done in Ethereum on chain, but scalability, front-running and ease of use just isn’t there yet (need everyone participating and having a global liquidity pool).
Dutch exchange implemented on chain to solve front running problems.
Integrating with USD price feed of Maker - was a little hard to depend on other people’s infrastructure and therefore the tests that they have deployed. We ended up mocking their service for test net, would have been awesome to just point at their package, specify a contract on either network and go without having to mock any of the other services.
Make sure that things like ETHPM are deployed across all test networks.
Also built the multisig wallet for our own token launch, has been very successful and we now want to offer the same experience for every user: more secure wallets for personal use that are even better than hardware wallets.

Expose state changes between blocks in an easy to consume fashion. Right now you apply txes, but you don’t know what effect on the state is immediately. You have to assume that you know, or listen to events.
But events shouldn’t even be there as they are just replication of info that is already there on the chain - just make that info more accessible and easy to read and use!!
State changes between blocks, sort of like a github diff that you can take and use to index in a secondary indexer - that would be really helpful.

Contracts written in solidity
Many pitfalls, especially for newcomers - need to read documentation 10 times and then sometimes you still don’t get it.
For e.g. the low-level stuff like .call() is implemented differently from what you might expect that caused funds to get stuck in multisig contracts.
The concept of gas is not that easy to understand and is not transparent.
If you use .send() you use minimum amount of gas versus .call() using all the gas.
Verification of code and garbage handling is not well documented - verifying down in the byte code is very difficult.
Particular problem for symbolic execution and all the additional checks that solidity is doing. Not well optimized at all.
If you access a storage variable twice, you will always have to pay twice, rather than optimizing to keep it in memory - very annoying in the end. Means you have to do a lot of gas optimisations yourself which really should be automatic.
These kind of issues require domain expertise - why don’t we all put up a $1 million bounty for a new smart contract language/compiler.[a]
Might be interesting to keep it lower level, something similar to Vyper with the much simpler bytecode and cheaper execution, better verification etc. We cannot have only one smart contract language.
Using truffle framework because it is most used framework and want their codebase to be as approachable as possible.
Debugging is an absolute pain in the ass - even truffle’s debugger is not great. No easy breakpoints, difficult to step through easily, or change variable to run different kinds of tests.
Would be better to statically typed testing environment - only test framework in JS (python one is not maintained). We need another framework that can go deeper and be more precise.
Web3 itself really sucks.
API versioning for ethereum json-rpc stuff. No versioning, no documentation, no proper error codes. Plenty of useful calls that are missing, plenty of calls that exist that no-one uses and it’s just chaos in general. We have to assume what version is running on the user end, so have to assume they are running all kind of different versions.
Everyone using MetaMask and Infura makes this slightly more hidden.
I proposed a new json rpc call but geth ahd already implemented it, but it was documented nowhere and Parity hadn’t really thought of doing it at the time, so there is no clear way of defining what the standard is.
Was about allowing users to sign offline transactions in a specific way: ask the client to sign and return the tx data that can be then used from an offline location.
We need a test suite against the json-rpc API: just to test that Geth and Parity are actually behaving in the same way.
Using Remix IDE - then go to local text editors for further dev once they are sure the contracts run well.
Would be amazing to have a properly integrated environment. Uses Atom with solidity linter. Would be great to be able to do proper debugging in that environment as well. Things work now because complexity is relatively small - but as soon as you want to integrate between projects it becomes a total mess.
Gas metering and fuzz testing in addition to break points, stepping through, and changing variables easily.
Use Mythril to check smart contract security, executions and test coverage. Aim for 100% code coverage and use solc code coverage.
Would love a tool with some basic checks (like overflows etc), but needs to be extended to do optimisations for gas efficiency, standard way to apply smart contract best practices automatically.
Map test coverage to code execution paths so that you can easily see which cases to write tests for. Something better than code coverage which only shows where you touch the line so that we can cover the most important scenarios (i.e. where things are failing).

Ideally there would be a testing env that can do “introspection” & which can evaluate the state of the memory. It should test the effect of code rather than the output of the code and make sure that the tests all integrate with Solidity.
It’s really hard to write unit test for the EVM state, as a result of some code executing. It would be good to have a test for this[a].

",contracts,,"Solidity is the wrong tool. Imperative language and everything on blockchain is declarative. Solidity should be declarative.
IVY is best example of for blockchain language. On blockchain control logic is impossible: blockchain never decides how or when a function is called. No such thing as on-chain control logic: off-chain controls how humans can manipulate state.
All lies: completely wrong tool for blockchain. This is what causes render mistakes: trying to write on-chain what happens, but should be defining what can/can not happen (Bitcoin: whether you can or cannot spend a UTXO).
Require statements example of Solidity becoming declarative language is not a good way to fix this and modifiers are an anti-pattern:
Either happens as atomic single unit at will of human or it doesn’t?
Configurable constraints on-chain: we should still define them as constraints -- no math happens on-chain (not actually adding 2+2 on chain).
Weird that tests are control logic for your code. Control logic is whether human makes a transaction.
Idea that we are writing things that add variables on-chain is wrong.
Reality of state, state root and blockheader is what causes a lot of the bugs
IVY: really heavy modification to write on ETH -- more easy to write languages for the EVM. A declarative language for EVM. Tooling for Solidity only recently got workable.
Onchain systems should define constraints around what cser can / cannot do -- they are the control logic of the program.
Cross chain contracts for integral is what users can and cannot do at what time and on what chain (declarative programming again).
Checks, Effect, Interactions to write code. We need more good programming to prevent race conditions, re-entrancy, double spend etc:
Transactions happen atomically, cant have overlap in state changes
Can shoe horn ETH into this by using Require / IF Statements (??)
Avoid modifiers as a pattern
That’s always the effect of the Solidity you’re writing - puts more pressure on the client
Makes testing more intuitive -- specified tests you’re testing against
Very interesting miner attack on EtherDelta: they front-run; make tx throw; collect the fees.
The problem with Solidity isn’t expressiveness; it is shared state. Other transactions can get ahead of you and modify state that you rely on.

Working on plasma and writing it in Go. Focussed on interoperability between Geth and smart contracts.
My development style:
I really like Java. – enterprise-y tools make me productive.
IDE could be really improved.
I use IntelliJ’s Solidity plugin to edit Solidity.
“Jump-to-def”; “jump-to-implementation”; syntax highlighting
Big difference in productivity.
E.g. when I’m writing Go code, I can jump to the Geth definition. This is amazing.
I’m switching between Solidity / Go, or Solidity / Javascript
Solidity Javascript bindings through Truffle are good.
Integrating libraries designed for cryptocurrencies with front-end apps is hard:
Bundle sizing: different behavior if you’re running in the browser or in the backend.
E.g. if you compile a contract with truffle, you get a JSON file – which has the bytecode and all this stuff beyond the ABI.
This is heavy and unused.
Crypto.js has unnecessary dependencies:
Eth.js includes an ASN.1 parser which parses digital certificates –– which isn’t needed for any crypto.js uses.
Google Chrome places a size limit (3 MB) on service workers in Incognito mode.
Bundle sizing is important – need to take out dependencies.
Standardize the interfaces for all these libraries.
E.g. a standardize library to read BIP39 seed words – across different programming languages.
Is there a Javascript API to boot a testnet, deploy contracts, and run tests against it?
For running application tests –
I want integration tests that run against Truffle easily
Having the ability to do this via Javascript is important
E.g. automate this: https://github.com/machinomy/machinomy/blob/master/run_integration_tests.sh
People don’t know how to productionize a geth node:
On Ubuntu: you can ‘apt-get install geth’
Now, how do you secure it, monitor it, etc?
People say: “just use Infura” – but then you’re tied to Infura.
Some ideas:
Docker instances; Chef or Ansible scripts; that setup a Geth node which has a bunch of best practices around it.
As an example:
Your RPC port shouldn’t be open to the external world, but should be accessible to the front-end.
You need a layer sitting between the geth node and the external world, and gives: 1) analytics, 2) authentication, and 3) audit logging.
The dashboard could configure geth on the fly.
How do you secure a geth node with an RPC port:
Need only certain keys to be allowed to interact with it
Jacky:
Integrating Metamask with Dapps
Building a new wallet for Spank;
It’s a service worker
Three threads running at once:
Runs a bunch of background processes
The Wallet
The Dapp itself
The messaging between these three threads sucks.
Cross-window JSON RPC library.
Wallets are pushing the limits of what Chrome is capable of.
They’ve had to file two bugs with Chrome in the last month.
Runs into the service worker size limit.
Mostly Javascript and Web3 work
Lot of code repetition in loading state and confirming transactions
Web3 is kinda hard to use – large ABIs
Biggest problem has been around event management.
Key management is not that complicated – Web3 has a good handle on it.
The Web 3 interaction with the wallet:
Web3 provider talks to the blockchain –
Spank and Metamask – the provider is an instance of the ZeroClientProvider – written by the Metamask team
The ZeroClient makes all calls when there’s no key needed. When a key is needed, it calls into your codebase.
Biggest problem is around the communication of gas costs.
The UX around this.
Users pick really high or low gas costs.
There are better ways to estimate gas.
Would be nice: currency conversion utility tools.
Existing tools are pretty buggy.
ETH has many different units.
Units conversion.
Matthew:
I write all my own methods – other than lowdash where I pull specific utils out.
React / Redux.
Need a way of shoving Web3 stuff into your Redux state.
Managing the lock state of your wallet
E.g. you need the lock-state of the wallet, because the UI changes.
They written a util that queries the wallet, gets it’s lock-state, and puts it into the Redux state.
Authentication: people have public/private keypair; use this data as login.
Having a canonical way to npm install and have authentication build off of Metamask.

﻿Liam Horne,"Co-founder of L4 and Counterfactual.
Two main things:
Leading the development of counterfactual: a generalised state channels framework and protocol. It’s a simple, intuitive framework for developing DApps using state channels - so we do a lot of work on Solidity code and general work around EVM interactions.
Co-founders of ETHGlobal - so I spend a bunch of time talking to hackers and making sure that these events represent genuine progress and that people aren’t just stuck on bugs. The output to time ratio needs to be as high possible.
","dapps, state channels, bugs, protocol","L4, Counterfactual, Solidity, EVM, ETHGlobal","Better UI testing. Would be awesome to have am MetaMask mock - wanna launch Chrome Canary, Safari, Moz and ganache will auto inject into the page some provider that could be used to test the full flow. We have also started work on this.
We need more to more people working on ethers.js!!
It is the best library out there, especially for quick operations, and we need like 5 more people at least working on it,
Web3 is too opinionated about exact use cases, whereas ethers is much more generic and simple and can have a lot of tools built on top of it.
We have been hesitant to develop non JS stuff, and haven’t yet because there is no ether.js equivalent. If there were an ethers equivalent in Rust that would be awesome.
In terms of solidity: ABI encode and decode (not written well yet, but will be super useful) are really game changing! It should be 0.3 or 0.4 or something!
Really bad documentation, especially around nuances to do with memory or storage objects etc.
When things happen in solidity, what you can do with it is not explained well.
For instance, one thing you can do is now use returndatasize to get the output bytes from some call you make. The minimum amount of code you need is a few lines of assembly.
However, this is not well known or used.
Our whole system is based on off-chain contract, and the rules in there need to be enforced by on-chain contracts. So I need to be able to interpret arbitrary function calls based on arbitrary logic/user input. This is very hard…
We do conditional payments, and these ensure that a bunch of things  are true, and then interpret the results of a bunch of functions and then take those outputs and pay people. All of these inputs, not contracts, and it gets complicated.
There is a specific error called unimplemented_error which comes up in a few cases. The only way to figure this out is to google it and there are 3 or 4 options to pick from, which seems sloppy.
Error messages could be much more specific about WHAT is unimplemented.
Would be great to see also in the docs WHY certain things are not yet implemented.
There’s some subtleties around exactly how libraries work in solidity. Will send through more details when editing.
Would be nice to have a debug mode for events, so that they will trigger regardless of whether or not there was an error so that we can use that as a console.og
Also, there should just be a console.log ;)
If you emit an event with a dynamic struct and pass it a dynamic struct, the whole thing doesn’t make it back in the logs: it only shows the top of the event. It certainly doesn’t show the whole thing.
Whenever you hit gasLimits, you should be able to find out easily where it stopped and what line it is stopping at.
Better documentation on the assembly command sand specific example usage of them would be really good.
Breakpoints with context - these are the variables and scope etc. I will sometimes play around with delegatecall and then I don’t even know which context I am in anymore and this can block me for extended periods of time.
There’s a bunch of sneaky tactics: like keyless signatures. There is a way to generate a sig for an exact and specific kind of tx from an account whose nonce is 0, because then the create opcode gives back a deterministic address.
Please can we document this!? There should be a person on stuff who just plays around with this stuff and then documents it.
This is very serious stuff, if there were a keyless-sig library, so many other things would also be available.
Better google results for Ethereum!
More literature on how Ethereum can be used to do the things people think other blockchains are better at.
Highlight ethresear.ch and some post sthere, like one from Vitalik about businesses paying gas fees for their uses, which is EOS’ biggest argument.
Even worse, explaining plasma, where it should be feasible to have no fees at all.

State channels are very light in terms of the actual contract code. But the off-chain contract code is a lot more complicated. It would be nice if all of the things we’re doing were easily runnable in the browser.
We have this concept of a module, which is some software that wraps a particular state channel application. We need code running in the client that determines whether or not it is safe to sign the next transaction, and where you store it, if you show it to the user at all etc.
We then have to implement a copy of what the contract does in JS and it would be way nicer if we just had a local environment to run some eWASM code because then we wouldn’t need to worry about the node at all. We wanna have it work in any random browser and WASm enables that.
Plasma and state channels require stripped and straight forward teams to work on this stuff that can build out all the tools we need.

Highest level comment: nice for specific use cases, but our use case does not match this. It’s built for writing a bunch of contracts, deploying them and interacting.
Our whole framework is based around off-chain interactions, for which Truffle is not well suited.
The whole Truffle networks thing is kind of annoying. If you want to ship a simple build that you put in your browser and run, it doesn’t work locally. You need to set up your own test environment.
Would be great to have a tool that could put together a super minified version of your ganache DB so that we could test across the same data.
We did some of this, but it’s not well known and not the default across the ecosystem.
Use ethers.js a lot
ABI encoder v2
Not supported by truffle.
Ganache
Can be very unreliable for a lot of important things.
E.g. bug in ecrecover on bytes (even if signed correctly) it will not return the correct address, It is just not implemented correctly, so we had to port over to Parity.
However, the parity dev client doesn’t throw errors on revert, it just logs them, and there is no option to change this.
The fact that the behaviours are different between these two things is concerning and frustrating.
Parity and Geth
I don’t understand why there isn’t just one-click Ganache replacement. If I just went to parity.heroku.app with a big button to launch an instance, that’d be awesome. Seems like low hanging fruit that could really be quite easily worked on.
Getting around all the configuration details is such a headache.
I just want to launch testnets, and even do so locally in a way that actually works in practice.
Anything to do with solidity at all really.
Libraries and tools
Remix

Typescript  - state channels need to run in the client, you want to be able to have code client side to decide what to sign and whether it is safe, and this is easiest in typescript. Would be better in WASM, but it’s not there yet.

There’s definitely missing features of what ethereum actually stores in its DB.
I would love if infura enabled the trace API, which is hugely expensive, that’s probably why they haven’t, but for now there is no way to give it an address and find all the transaction (or even a transaction) from that address.
Would be great if you could just tell me the first tx hash that a given address ever made. Obviously this vastly increases cost of an ethereum node to run, but would be useful.
Events are just wildly unreliable. This is why ENS stores things on chain. Events don’t work well enough to do what you need to do. If I need to look this up, I can’t.
The main reason is if you indexed all that stuff all the time, it would constitute a huge load. So most people aren’t doing that. Scarce details of how they aren’t is the problem...

Contract compilation time is slow. We use Truffle compilation, which I thinks uses Javascript-bindings for C++ compiler.
Sometimes the compilation takes longer than the tests.
Running C++ compiler (solc) without the Javascript binding is way faster.
Can Truffle use the Solidity compiler internally, without the JS binding?
Maybe this is an easy feature add[a].
I’ve played with DappHub. It’s much faster.
It would also be helpful to specify a compiler version to use without using a completely different version of Truffle
If you make a change, Truffle tries to be smart about which contracts to recompile. Sometimes this doesn’t work and you need to blow away /build dir and recompile. Not a great UX.
In ‘truffle console’: using JS promises are annoying –– can be verbose and hard to read.
Would be cool: having a transformation of that console, if it had async/await, or some kind of wrapper to make things seem synchronous.

Writing the Go client:
Pain point: nonce management –
Options:
Geth web3.sendTransaction: geth sets the nonce for you.
The other option is to pick the nonce yourself.
For our client, we do the nonce management ourselves: there’s a method to get the Nonce, and includes transactions in “pending” state, but you don’t know them if you’re not a miner.
This is an issue if you submit concurrent transactions.
Parity has a custom method called nextNonce, which works properly –

Invested in Bitcoin since 2013, huge fan of the philosophy of crypto. I forgot about it during the 3-year bear market, then interest resurged in 2017 when I discovered Ethereum
My co-founder Luke was working as lead developer at crypto company called Block Mason
I wanted to build new project because I was running into scalability issues on Ethereum. Matt was running into same issues -- things were too expensive and some really bad UI in general.
The project evolved a lot: the initial idea was called ETHDeploy. We were giving people a way to spin up EVM-based side chains on private test networks for demo’ing and user trials.
Digital Ocean style way to spin up ETH-based blockchains.
To get adoption, we needed to build up our own applications. When we started doing that, we realized it didn’t make sense to build EVM stuff in Solidity and built in Go.
Need developers building on platform - so built CryptoZombies
First, we built ETHFiddle which is Fiddle for Solidity -- like JSFiddle (inbrowser IDE for Ethereum to share code. Like Remix, but you can quickly share code snippets.)
","philosophy, scalability, UI, adoption, Go, browser, IDE","Bitcoin, Ethereum, EVM, Digital Ocean, CryptoZombies, EthFiddle, Solidity, Remix","Deployment is “tough” - initial problem we set out to solve
When first building DAPP, testnets are a mess:
Just don’t work at all - people eating up all the transaction bandwidth or DDOS them.
Faucet to get ETH on testnet is hard to find and use at scale.
Setup local development with Truffle / Ganache, which is fine, but once you want to get it live to demo or do anything really useful, it is quite a headache.
Our CTO just deployed it to testnet, which was less of a headache. However, deployment to mainent itself is quite difficult
ETHDeploy: auto populate wallet with huge amount of Ether; test things without having multiple steps; blockchain clone.
Became less of a focus for us. Doing something with Loom had potentially a much bigger audience and more use cases.
Still need transaction costs on main-net down!
Our argument is that not everything involves high storage of value / sensitive data (doesn’t need full decentralization), but we still want important parts on main-net (character data, owning items)
Delegate Call (first app): users earn karma and tokenized karma they can transfer to mainnet for contributing to site.
Could load cryptokitty into platform (ERC-20 + ERC721)
Storing hashes of large amount of data verifiable on side chain. Mostly using relay to transfer tokenized assets
Limited experience on mobile, which limits user adoption. Steep learning curve there

﻿Matthew Di Ferrante‏,"Audits
Some clients have their own testnets. Or some chain state that needs to be initialized before you can run the code.
Smart contract dev –
Decentralized exchange project –
Testing that is hard. You need to deploy on chain; there’s a vault, ownership, hierarchy. How does the moving average work? You gotta run a 1000 trades and they have to be from the same account, etc etc
I wish these tools had a dev mode – where you can deterministically generate accounts
Geth & Truffle & etc should have a 1000 accounts that always show up as the first 1000 accounts.
E.g. for testing signatures.
There should be a templated test environment; that you can use across environments, installations, etc.
I find himself editing this a lot.
People often give me tests which have addresses hard-coded in. I then  have to set it up again.
Consistency:
Getting projects to sync up; or a tool to initialize the setup for different projects.
Can use ganache or testrpc upto a certain point, but then, it doesn’t scale.
Something that takes one second to run in geth, takes 20-30s on ganache.
A tool that seeds the addresses, accounts – environment imaging.

On my own computer: I don’t use ‘npm install global’ or ‘npm’ at all –– I’ve created my own vagrant script, which specifies where I install stuff.
It takes a long time – 1, 2 hours – to update part of the environment.
It’s a huge barrier to entry
Also, a huge barrier to experimentation.
Making something where you can from idea to execution, would be great.
Remix doesn’t work for complex interactions, or with something that’s already onchain.
Things get truncated in Javascript.
I wrote my own Python stuff – for handling bignum calculations and submitting to the contract.
We need better support for interaction with contracts that have non-trivial inputs:
E.g. if you need to some pre-processing.
Common patterns across projects I’m auditing:
There’s limitations to the Solidity compiler – simple fixes could help the rest of the ecosystem make less mistakes:
E.g. imports:
If you import an interface, then you have to link to a contract onchain. Or you can directly import a contract.
Having a pre-approved list of contracts –– there’s no reason to be redeploying things on the chain.
Ethpm does this – but worth adding support for this in the compiler itself?
People roll their own complex math:
Because Solidity doesn’t have floating point, people come up with binomial approximations etc.
Talk through a complex audit and how the process works:
First: site-read the code.
Notice small details: e.g. there’s an unbounded loop here.
Setup the environment
Actually execute the code.
Step through the code with a debugger:
I use EVMLab – shows opcode per line with the state.
Notes:
I have a lot of hack-ish tools I’ve built himself. Would be nice to standardize these.
For audits: I don’t look at the offchain stuff.
How do I get testnet eth?
On Ropsten: I have a server.
Some clients have their own testnets; I forward through their machines
If I need a lot of testnet eth (eg. testing a reverse dutch auction): I might spin up my own dev net.
Moar?
Having a setup tool, like truffle init, which initializes keystore and an initial chain state where each of those addresses have a balance

Gas prices.
Metamask can share learnings from their support team.
Whymarrh is introduced in contributing few hours.
Thinks videos or walk-through could be the best medium for explaining complex things.
Kauri can have specific documentation for technical stuff.
Transaction confirmations
We need to explain what is happening to our users. The DApp could be lying about what’s happening, which makes it extra complicated/interesting.
Metamask receives a tx from the DApp, but no more info.
How do you convert that into a message to the user?
“It looks like its talking to a token contract; or sending a random blob of data...”
Take that low-level data and have to convey to the user what’s happening.
We have special cases – e.g. a token transfer, this is an ERC721, this is a DAO proposal, etc.
There’s non-normal stuff – e.g. what’s it like for a sidechain?
Multi-network –– how would it work for non-Ethereum stuff?
E.g. secure scuttlebutt.
E.g. Filecoin, Dfinity, etc.
E.g. Plasma chains inside of Ethereum.
Standardization of transactions, blocks, signatures, etc.  –– not bounty-able right now. Need to build an architecture around it.
Then, you need plugins, which could be a good fit bounties.
Scaling. We have 1m users...
A lot of the work for scaling has happened inside of Infura.
Part of it is just throwing money on the fire.
They developed a REST api for json rpc. So now they can put a CDN in front of it, and get caching.
But now, a standard provider can’t point at the REST interface.
Seems like the big need is for standardization.
E.g. Maker’s ERC20 version doesn’t match the standard.
That’s not because we don’t have enough conversation, it’s that we don’t have real governance.
Infura is an existential risk for Metamask, because it’s expensive and we’re a non-profit.

There’s a road map that needs to be executed for this to work. If I had to guess, here’s how it might unfold:
A client team with incentive to encourage a hard fork might implement “accepting on-chain hard fork proposals with client parameters” as a way to make it easier to develop the hard fork, in a community-focused way that gives users the power of choosing future forks in general, not merely supporting their own interests.
Once one client has implemented this, they should advertise their client as the client that gives the user the most control over the fork policy that their client uses, in hopes to either steal users to that client, or pressure other client developers to relinquish their own privileged decision making position by implementing support for the same.
There will probably be a friction period, either where some client devs don’t want to support this feature (either out of conviction or seeing it as a waste of time, since they may not want or need any hard forks), and so it might come down to people who have the most at stake (for example, people hoping for a funds recovery) to fund the development of this general feature for all clients.
If core client developers aren’t interested in supporting user-chosen hard fork policies, and refuse to review/merge these PRs, that might be a good reason to fork those clients, with hopes to merge after the changed version is proven stable.
IMO, any client not favorable to a user configured fork choice rule is entrenching their own power, and informed users should flock away from those clients as other alternatives emerge.

Dive into lower level Ethereum libraries a lot - ethjs-utils especially.
You have to understand what is going on and WHY you’re doing it. This context is tough to get across and the libraries here are just not as well advertised, which is a pity.
It’s a maturity thing: early on you’re just trying to attract people and get them to get their hands dirty. As the community matures, you need more forward-facing, lower-level libraries that are well documented available is absolutely key. You can only do so much with vanilla web3..
One of their new implementations is a new multisig wallet, picking up some stuff from ERC 191, added some things to address security concerns.
None of that stuff is in web3, so using ecsign method from utils in order to avoid going onchain all the time to get info that is available elsewhere.
More attention around lower level components is useful as we mature.

There is a group working on anti-phishing. We share information and data through an established channel.
We now have a bot to run ops on domains (whois data gathering, DNS records, SSL dumps, Shodan data on the server)
We have also deployed an archive bot on Twitter @EthereumBadList

Some dependencies for Truffle and the build they were using were missing.
Integrating Ethereum with browser hasn’t been too troubling.
I look at Etherscan comments + MyCrypto support tickets comments.
Anti-phishing – Etherscan blacklists bad addresses, through their moderation queue and etherscamdb.info reports.
Most people don’t realize a Private Key should stay private
Airdrop sites require you to put in your private keys.
How to prevent phishing:
Metamask added domain blacklisting + my extension.
I plan to do analysis using PrestoDB, finding common outputs across Ethereum phishing addresses. E.g. If most addresses go through Shapeshift, then go through Monero, can then contact Shapeshift to add their blacklists.
Big data requires a beefy server to run it on.
Open-source for big data analysis of chains for fraud. I talked with Chainalysis (they do Bitcoin analysis) about the idea
I haven’t wanted to do this – mainly because of cost & security. I’m looking into servers which could handle rate-limited requests.

Best thing for ecosystem right now is: educational, marketing, videos, tutorials, write-ups, explaining how things work.

In the beginning, MEW was a stepping stone for people who already owned cryptocurrencies, before they started using geth or parity or etc.
Now, this is no longer the case, there’s new people who don’t know anything about cryptocurrencies at all..

PROBLEMS: Security
Internal security processes.
At two people you can trust each other; access is limited. At team of 20 it’s different; have to revamp internal policies; reminding people of things.
Found 2 Slack admins not have 2fa on.
We are bigger target; we get password resets.
Someone stole her number in October but they were prepared for it. They handled everything really well.
DNS and internal security on infrastructure.
Hired ex-director of security for Coinbase & Facebook. Works on board of Hackerrank.
How we hired: people who use MEW want to keep Ethereum & MEW safe. We connected on security. We had a call that afternoon.
He does amazing security incident response & red-teaming.
FEW DIFFERENT SECURITY CONCERNS:
How we serve their code: a commit is pushed to a specific branch; that is served to github.io; then AWS pulls that code, caches the hell out of it, and that serves MEW.com.
All keys are rotated, and ssh private keys are kept very secret.
multi-stage pipeline (Github + AWS); both have multi-factor security, need Ubikey, etc.
It’s kind of a staging pipeline.
Prevents bad commits or bad UI changes from getting into the website.
How do you QA things, how do you test things?
We wait 24 hours from creating a release and getting it on a live domain.
We have a series of tests – check that everything compiled correctly, check that all links have a rel=no-opener on them, ..
DNS
After EtherDelta and ClassicEtherWallet.
We have a custom thing: three services to monitor the site.
We serve through a CDN
Diff the code – diffs the new website with the previous version of them.
Gets the hash of the Javascript and CSS with previous versions.
Blockchain security
Ensuring the user makes good decisions –– how do you alert or notify a user when is doing something wrong –– e.g. notifies you when an Ethereum address is not formatted correctly?
How do you build this: check the balance?
Have microservices that have micro-databases of the blockchain.
Caching token balances.
On MEW: pulls everything from Parity or Geth directly.
Can run their infra through Cloud Formation ––
Geth falls out of sync.
CryptoKitties destroyed their infrastructure.
Intel chip thing then took them 120% CPU usage, took them offline.
Fixes for Spectre and Meltdown.
PROBLEM: phishing & supporting after the fact.
PROBLEM: infrastructure:
Keeping nodes Parity & Geth up all the time.
Additional issue: Blockchain naturally re-writes itself if you’re on a microfork. If you’re also distributing this across your own database, then you need to write code to also rewrite this. Etherscan just gave up and booted up from the blockchain from scratch.
This is what Infura is trying to do. They are in the same situation as MEW and Etherscan. They are under Consensys so have more financial freedom.
Shapeshift sysadmin stole money. If they had the problem, then this is a big problem.
What is the cost of security in this space? How much a malicious people could stand to gain…
With a debit card, it’s not the same –– there is risk of getting caught, the original person gets the money back etc.
Traditional security systems won’t work for this.
When I worked at AT&T, I asked people how they trained people to not steal simcard numbers. The real cost is not cost of buying a phone.
UNEXPECTED PROBLEM: building remote team culture
I work well remotely; but building culture while remote is really important.
In-person hangouts – all devs will be at EthDenver.
Make them talk about personal stuff on calls.
Big question is to: how to make remote team work.
Danielle leads the dev team.
Over the summer, they did a hire fast fire fast mentality. Sink or swim type of game. People need to be able to orient themselves.

Management for users and development

Being pragmatic about scaling, a Layer 2 Solution. Not really sidechains, all value is only defined as value of ERC20.

OpenOSTBase- a bunch of wrappers around the websockets around web3, make these more reliable and redundant. In production, things tend to break but this helps with that. Happy to contribute back :)
Web3.js is a first level API. First layer access to the technology, but want to have a more user friendly second layer that caters to the community needs. More user friendly, without having to do the same thing several times. We want a second level API, a helper or utility level API.
What tools don’t exist at the moment?
Haven’t super explored Ganache but is interested in more things done via command line. Any type of automation that can be done from the command line is cool and greatly helps with efficiency.
Biggest thing we are missing is an IDE suited for the ecosystem. Something that could do a gas function on Remix done on runtime, you could see security things happening on runtime. Integrating Remix with a different IDE, it’s currently statically bound.
Clear explanation in Documentation.
General level: a big proponent of multiple chain universes. In OST users only really interact with Ethereum mainnet, only have tooling directed towards one chain.
Solidity perspective, have a diagram based solution to see all the connections. Solidity codebase diagram module would be very compelling.
How do you handle smart contract verification and security?
Guiding principles: observe standards and don’t invent funny ways of doing things. Trying to reduce code to smaller components and go from there. Had 3 security auditors. Cure53 reviewed contracts and all traditional architecture. Zeppelin did audit for smart contracts.
Now working on the hardcore protocol. TrailOfBits builds a lot of interesting tools examining the bytecode. This is not an easy task. Trying to take very small steps one at a time and then go from there is the philosophy.
They are excited about ewasm. They respect work done with Solidity, but bytecode is the biggest thing. They have compiled with same Solidity on Mac and Linux for same thing and got different bytecode, this is a big concern.
Compiler, assembly tools, and debug tools are all major points of interest. Could be interesting if Solidity compiles to wasm, then you have portability.
What was the hardest part about learning to develop with Ethereum?
To set up the first private network was somewhat difficult. Didn’t use Truffle, just Geth. Geth is very powerful but is missing good documentation and had to Google.
Solidity is good but needs better docs and better exampling. Very happy with CryptoZombies tutorials, want to see more things like this to help intro new users into the space.
Hardest thing when you deploy something is deploying a smart contract that intends to have value but not having a way to walk it back. In the last weeks running up until their deployment, did 8 dry tests with a self-destruct button. Ran this 8 times on Ropstein testnest, and then mainnet. Very interested in smart tooling to help in this process!
More tooling for testing of deployment. Testing where deployment happened properly to avoid situations like Parity Wallet. Had Monex with EthPM like tool. Scripting the deployment. Testing the deployment, could be a part of an automation toolset. Like fastlane for ios and android deployment.
What are you most excited about in the short term?

Foundational work for WASM:
WASM interpreter
Runtime environment – which allows to run wasm within any network.
Forking Kovan – allowing wasm contracts to run
Running wasm on private chains
WASM interpreter:
Main problem:
Making the Rust interpreter deterministic.
WASM is not strictly deterministic –– need to narrow down to deterministic opcodes.
Need to ban several opcodes, e.g. floating points. Simple solution: just parse WASM and fail if there’s any floating point opcodes.
Other option: to canonicalize the NaN constant –– you need to bring all these flags under one definition.
One idea: you could check after each floating point opcode –– to see if its NaN and use canonical.
BUT this is not worth the effort, because no blockchains apps will have floating point anyway.
Other sources of determinism: deterministic stack for execution
WASM doesn’t enforce size of the stack ––
When you get to JIT compilation of WASM, this compiles into using a register-machine specific to the hardware architecture; this process is actually deterministic.
But it’s non-deterministic when you go to run it.
E.g. when a function uses a lot of stack –– e.g. a recursive function that calls itself and itself –– it can fail when it hits the stack limit of the operating system.
This can fail at different times for different machines. So, it’s non-deterministic.
We’re transforming existing WASM into this modified WASM that takes care of these issues.
Any WASM implementation that takes untrusted code from the network needs to have this stuff done.
eWASM collaboration will be helpful ––
Mozilla has a Rust-WebAssembly group.
Gas metering – not challenging but needs to be done
We have tools which transform WASM from free-form to gas-metered form.
Includes how much opcodes cost.
eWASM has this also –– we’re taking a more scientific approach to this.
Parity simply uses the eWASM table.
Don’t need to be super precise, just need to protect against malicious users.
Memory also costs gas.
Simple way is to charge for memory linearly.
The original idea is to charge for extra memory quadratically more given how much memory was allocated before – but you don’t need to do this anymore, because there’s new ways to allocate memory.
Gas costs are embedded into the bytecode.
Proving the correctness of implementation
Fuzz testing against various interpreters – spec implementation;
Fuzz test: allow the interpreter to run code; it should fail or do the same thing at exactly the same spots as other interpreters or existing codebases.
The interpreter should not panic in any case –– otherwise, malicious actor could crash certain nodes
They use cargo-fuzz for rust
There are also fuzzing tools for WebAssembly: which can generate randomized wasm modules –– can take this; put it into your implementation and the reference implementation; and see that they do the same thing.

This will be used to assign costs to Opcodes, and also know exactly why.
Parity is using eWASM’s results for this currently.
","opcodes, analysis","eWASM, Parity",,,,,,,"What is the difference between eWASM and parity-wasm?
Parity works closely with WASM ––
Parity uses the same endianness as EVM. But eWASM uses little-endian / WASM uses little-endian.
How does eWASM callcode, because it depends on hardware architecture?
Parity forbids some useless constructions, e.g. “internal memory” ––
Any WASM module can include private memory; according to wasm-spec it’s not accessible at runtime; Parity forbids this.
Projects working on WASM:
Parity, eWASM, Dfinity, Bitfury
Bitfury has Exonum – solution for enterprise blockchains with WASM runtime.
Higher-level languages: Rust or anything else that compiles into WASM.
They’ll move away from Solidity. – good to have for backward compatibility (so someone making solidity-wasm compiler would be good) but not necessary.
Standardizing WASM implementations:
Can do renames to match eWASM or something like that.
Interoperability amongst WASM implementations:
Will have a simple tool that can compile eWASM to parity-wasm to etc etc.
WASM vs. EVM:
WASM doesn’t force you to use the 256-bit machine.
E.g. if your computations fit 32-bit, you don’t have to deal with this inefficiency.
WASM has strong teams behind it.
They’ve made a bet on WASM; so there will be resources behind it.
Bugs will get fixed by the wider community.
WASM can be targeted by mature languages: c++, Rust, Haskell is coming, etc

I was the developer relations manager at 0x.
I am now focussing on state channels, signature-based improvements in general smart contracts, blockchain storage (utilising merkle trees and improving best practices).
Working with a gaming project that utilises state channels, unrelated to Raiden.
A lot of things that could be done off-chain by simply using different signatures: for crowdsales instead of using on-chain whitelist, you send a signed message for every participant and then they need to pass that message along with sending their Ether. Used by Polymath to get around the gas costs (could cost up to $15 000 just to whitelist everyone).
Working with chronologic on Ethereum Alarm Clock and other secondary markets, e.g. conditional execution where I want to make sure if x happens somewhere on chain, then do y.
Right now smart contracts don’t listen to each other and require 3rd parties to watch the chain and inform them.
","research, state channels, signatures, storage, off chain, contracts","0x, Raiden, Polymath, Ethereum Alarm Clock",,,,"Nothing exists for state channels regarding how you pass messages and other p2p tools that allow different agents to communicate easily with each other.
Not easy to document this.
No easy way to test how peers are interacting with each other and you want to run simulations in state channels.
Scheduled transactions: we need a queue to avoid race transactions, can help lower gas costs. But we need off-chain system for nodes to communicate in order to implement that.
Easy to use and easy to test frameworks for this stuff is going to be super important.
Would be awesome to have some kind of simulation tool for multi-agent networks of this kind (even relevant for whisper and other parts of the Ethereum network, like zeppelin doing token mechanics simulations and analysis, especially around bad agents). More of a research tool than developer specific.
Simulator for the cross-client, cross-account signature schemes and management - right now the only way to test these schemes are to actually plug in a ledger and then test. Would be great to be able to test this from one place!
Couldn’t make this work in Truffle, passing in byte code and passing. But then, using mycrypto or Remix, it failed because the encoding, libraries and dependencies are different!!
Very confusing how bytecode arrays are passed in different tools and how you can convert from one type to the other, how we could concatenate a range of arguments in a single contract and then vice versa. Figuring out how that works (argument encoding) is really difficult to get right.

Solidity dev is not particularly difficult, but the best practices are extremely important and it is only really by experience that you learn the best and safest patterns. You need to know most edge cases and most potential attacks before you can write contracts that can actually be used.

Py-EVM: python implementation of EVM in python.
Sharding & Casper research team are building on this.
Web3.py: python equivalent of web3.js
V4 is coming along nicely and is fairly solid right now.
Under the above – there are a myriad of base libraries that I’m the developer –– i.e. side-effects of the work.
Package management
Similar to Populus –– but actually the underlying core package-management structure. The solution is ready, it just needs to be built.

Has had multiple conversations with cdetrio on Github.
Bounty: needs clear documentation: “for your EVM to be included in the Hive tests, you need this stuff.”
Maybe it’s not super high impact and not crisply defined
Bounty: need a formal spec for the Json RPC api.
Have integrations tests in Web 3. Subtle differences across nodes, which make things confusing.
Somebody needs to shepherd the ERC spec through –– most of the work is done. Dan Finlay already hammered out most of the work.
Someone needs to write the schema for all Json RPC endpoints.
This is super well defined.
","bounties, documentation, RPC","EVM, GitHub, Hive",,,"Web: React / redux, create-react-app",,,,"Package management:
First piece: the spec
ERC whatever that defines the spec –– this is v1.
https://github.com/ethpm/ethpm-spec
There is very minor adoption of this.
There is a v2 of this spec –– couple of tweaks to fix stuff that was wrong in the first one. This is mostly written up, needs PRs to be written and merged.
Second piece: the implementation.
There is an early Python implementation –
https://github.com/pipermerriam/py-ethpm
but you need this in every language.
Needs various abstractions, for how to get deployed contracts –– returns language-specific object to you.
Third piece: a standard –– an ERC for package registries.
https://github.com/ethpm/ethpm-spec/issues/75
Standard methods for looking up what versions of the package exist, what is the hash / IPFS / HTTP URI.
Fourth piece: implementation of the registry as a smart contract.
There’s an already implementation of this in the EthPM github.  Needs to be simplified.
https://github.com/ethpm/escape/blob/master/contracts/PackageIndex.sol
Having this in Zeppelin or Dapphub.
The fifth piece: can have tooling + ENS nicencess to automatically deploy to registry for you.
Web3.js and Web3.py can implement methods to talk to packages –– can find the packages, pull them, use the right abstractions.
e.g. you load up the Gnosis package, pull the latest version, pull it out of your web3.py, and query for your contract balance.
Theoretical API: `web3.packaging.registry(‘packages.gnosis.eth’).loadPackage(‘gnt>=1.2.3’).contracts.gnt`
You get a really secure way of accessing contracts
Each company can create their own registry.
What do you need?
Two moderately skilled Python devs who know about Ethereum.
Two can keep each other in check – it’s healthier.
Could have MVP for this in Web3.py in 2-3 months. For the full thing. Could have an alpha release.
What does wider adoption look like?
Every etherscan contract can be wrapped up in a package.
At this point Etherscan becomes a package registry.
Verifying package source on Etherscan becomes trivial –– you upload a package to Etherscan.
No more need for janky copy-pasting source code.
Wallet interfaces:
MyEtherWallet –– instead of having address or ABI, you can upload the package or let you browse the registry and pick a package to interact with it.
Mist Ethereum wallet –– “track this contract” –– can show you a thing on the top that says you’re not using the latest version of this package. You get a security bonus –– to notice if you’re using an old package.
Development framework use-case for packaging!
Is the one that’s most talked about, but is probably the last one that will happen.  It requires complex integration between compiler and on-chain assets that might be stateful.
The base libraries however are needed as a stepping stone to build these features on top of.
NOTE:
Piper can lead defining this as a bounty and setting the milestones.
$50k/$60k feels like enough to attract attention. Can potentially get ETH foundation to fund part of the bounty.
Web3.py
Been using Gitcoin pretty heavily –– has been highly effective. Any task that they can define well, they can get done through Gitcoin reliably.
Trinity –– Python Ethereum node
Some use-cases will be greatly improved by third-party libraries
There is a solid abstraction around the database.
Generating a SQL backed chain db would hugely help research.
Take an existing chain db and migrate it into a SQL db. Or just sync the chain into SQL.
Maybe you only move the transaction and block data into the SQL db.
Another use-case for Trinity:
Spin it up on Heroku – it’s an ephemeral environment – for that to be a viable way to run your own Ethereum node.
Issue: how long does it take to initialize. In its lightest light-client mode, should be ready in sub-1 minute timeline.
Trinity and PyEVM have the most resources available out of the things they’re working on.

﻿Jay Rush,"QuickBlocks works with the Ethereum blockchain from the data side. How does one get usable, fast data out of the blockchain (as opposed to putting into the blockchain with a smart contract for example). Our work is fully decentralized (gets all of its data directly and only from the node); We take a bottom-up approach. We run for particular accounts or groups of account, not necessarily chain-wide. We retrieve and store only what the end user asks for.
","data, contracts","QuickBlocks, Ethereum","Biggest concern: The idea of decentralization is being lost
People are developing applications that are highly centralized, because it’s practical. Many projects promise they will one day decentralize, but I’m concerned that this will get increasingly more difficult as the technical debt grows. Many projects are deeply relient on highly centralized infrastructure (Infura, EtherScan).
Concern: The law of unintended consequences:
Identification Systems
Ease of use is very enticing
Blockchain based identity is easily applicable for government use
But...what happens when a “bad-actor” government or an oppressive regime requires citizens to all have unforgeable identity. How will innocent people who are legitimately against the regime hide themselves?
I wrote about this here.
Reputation Systems
If we move to a world where everyone has an immutable reputation--by definition half of the population will always have a worse reputation than the other half. Due to the nature of feedback loops, this feels like a bad idea.
Concern: The data is too difficult to use
Per Account Lists of Transactions:
Accounting for both incoming and outgoing external transactions is easy. Just scan to and from fields looking for a given address.
Accounting for outgoing message calls (Etherscan calls these internal transactions) is also pretty easy. The smart contract itself initiated the message call -- send an event.
Accounting for incoming internal transactions is very difficult. One must look at every message call generated by the entire system to fully account for all incoming internal transactions (witness air drops). I wrote about this here.
Bloom filters:
Every transaction receipt has a logsBloom field. These are ‘rolled up’ into the block level. Blocks also have a logsBloom field.
As the number of transactions per block increases (as it has done), the block-level bloom filters are getting more and more saturated. As they become more saturated, they will tend to report more false positives.
At the receipt level, the logsBloom are probably under-utilized (that is, they could hold more information without a large increase in false positive rate).
These two factors tend to make the logsBloom field both less effective than it could be and at the same time require more storage than they need to.
I wrote about this here.
Furthermore, the bloom filters exclude certain ‘addresses’ that, if they were included, would allow us to implement an RPC entry point called ‘eth_listAddressesInBlock(bn)’. This would be a compromise between a full index of addresses per block and re-scanning every trace for addresses if one wanted to build a list of transactions per address (which one would want to do if one wanted to audit a smart contract for example).
What QuickBlocks does: Do not store either the block level nore the receipt level blooms from the raw data. Instead, at each block, build an enhanced bloom filter which (1) includes every address involved in the block including those used as ‘data’ for internal transactions (ERC20 transfers and air drops), fill the bloom filters to a predetermined level (configurable, defaults to 200 bits), and when one bloom fills up, create another one at the same block. Result: significantly less storage devoted to blooms, consistent level of false positives resulting in less overall searching, ability to quickly answer ‘is this address used anywhere in this block’ with perfect fidelity.
Inefficiencies
Sept-Oct 2016 DDos transactions make requesting traces astronomically slow. I wrote about this here and here. Suggestion: easier way to identify (and skip over) dDos transactions.
When you use ‘eth_getTransactionByHash’, the RPC does not return the transaction receipt. In order to get the receipt, you must later call ‘eth_getTransactionReceipt’. You need the receipt to understand if the transaction was ended in failure. Twice as many calls to RPC than needed. Suggestion: staple the receipt to the transaction with an optional parameter to eth_getTransaction.
Transaction Error Codes prior to Byzantium Fork:
After the Byzantium Fork, getting the error status of a transaction is easy. If the ‘status’ field of the receipt is zero, then the transaction ended in error [There may be some edge cases here, we are reviewing this claim].
Prior to Byzantium, one had to search every transaction trace looking for a trace that contains the word ‘error’.
If one is doing historical analysis prior to the Byzantium fork, or trying to gather lists of transactions per account, one has to look at every trace.
Core developers seem more focused on what’s happening at the front of the chain (understandably); rather than getting the data out of the chain. Even though getting the data out is as important.
Suggestion: It would be useful to include a status field in pre-byzantium receipts at the option of the caller of the RPC.
The need for ABI definitions
Get Solidity to make the ABI available, because it makes analysis simpler.
Get people to understand the importance of providing ABIs.

Applications:
When you develop smart contracts, you get event data from web3. But this only give you generated events. In-error transactions are not seen because they do not generate events
Can analyze tokens.
Can do smart contract monitoring / early warning system
Should write monitoring code which watches blockchain – if it notices something weird, your contract can react. If the DAO had had events in it.
Was involved in the DAO. Stunning how little information was available. It took many hours for anyone to notice the hack because no-one was actively watching
I did some analysis of DAO hack. The actual hack is very obvious in the data on the very first block.
Would appreciate intros and connections to other projects.

From an email follow-up (possible bounty I might pay for):
For a particular range of blocks (preferably in the millions), and using a given list of Ethereum account addresses (one of which will be an ERC20 token, addresses to be specified in the bounty), provide a definitive list of all internal message calls and external transactions along with, at the end of each block, a reconciliation of each address’ ether balances. Additionally, at the end of each day in the block range, provide a list of token holders along with each token holder's token balances. The source of the data must be provided. Using 3rd party websites (such as Etherscan) is permitted, but the source of the data must be disclosed. Preference is data provided directly from a local Ethereum node.
The given list of address will be interrelated and taken from a prominent ERC20 token system. One of the addresses will be an regular, external account. Another will be an ERC 20 token smart contract. A third will be a multi-sig wallet. The deliverable will be JSON data showing all internal and external transactions for each address. The delivered data must ‘parse’ the transactions to the smart contracts (that is, the transaction’s input data field must be converted from the hexadecimal to “the language of the smart contract”. The deliverable will be a collection of JSON files formatted using a jsonlinter with specific settings which would allow for diffing results with other methods. Performance metrics will be provided as well. The results must be made open source so as to provide the smart contract auditing community with a ‘gold standard’ of community vetted results to be used for testing/verifying new or existing off-chain auditing tools/software.

Web3 library
In Web3 have send transaction method - no wrapper around it or other functions that people can use, and use more safely. Would like to see web3 safe send transaction (locate transaction in EVM to check if transaction passed. If its fine, transaction is sent, and if not there is a warning).
“Wrapper around Send Transaction Function”
Possible to develop transaction which fails. If you want to develop a transaction, you first have to send/execute it (but don’t want to lose money). Execute transaction locally, wait for trace and then debug it. Think this is what Truffle is using.
Contract’s with specific values: in code, write maximums to revert transactions - can this be added in front-end (ie. limiting contracts values so when transaction is sent there is a check beforehand so you can be sure you don’t make mistakes).
Would require changes in solidity to provide this functionality to web3

Remix is an entry point for users
But it’s hard to use for beginners.
It’s hard to use if you don’t know blockchain or the tech behind it.
There’s documentation and videos on youtube – still hard to use.
Idea: do UX user interviews
take a beginner developer or new user, and let them use Remix (or other tools), check out what the main flows are, what are their main questions,
They have two people – who come from front-end dev. When they started 6 months ago, they didn’t know blockchains, so their feedback was helpful.
There are three kinds of blockchain users
1) front-end dev: wants to use the blockchain to build UI, but doesn’t care about contracts.
2) contract developer
3) administrator: not writing code, but still needs to call contracts or send transactions to them.
Remix is not focused on front-end devs right now. They’re not targeting these people. They target contract developers or admins who “use” contracts.
Is there a tutorial, or a beginner contract that it initializes:
Yes. There is a “ballot” contract – but it’s kinda opaque and hard to understand.
Docs: remix.readthedocs.io
Has a quick start page.
Need to improve: onboarding for “administrator” users (above). So they can use Remix without making errors.
Two bounties
User testing for various blockchain-user personas (above).
Making tutorials or videos for beginners using Remix.
Building the static analysis tab:
Need to add more modules.
There will be a way to add plugins in Remix
Let’s say you are an external contributor, you’ll be able to add code, but the code won’t be in the Remix github, but in its repo and it’s added as a plugin.
E.g. Solium integration.
We are architecting the plugin API with the Solium team.
Another example: Oyente –– we’re integrating it as a plugin.
Potential bounty in the future:
Writing good documentation around this. We’re all super busy devs, and need people to help with documentation.
Last week – someone created an Electron app for Remix –– self-driven contributor; would be nice if they can post Github issues and have people contribute and get rewarded.

Middle of this year, started Samsara Protocol. Started with idea of selling real estate on chain, and decided to use a raffle based system to do this.
Abstract idea from property to raffling all kinds of assets.
Smart contract developer in general.
",contracts,Samsara Protocol,"Syncing my node to the chain has become really difficult. I used to do this a lot last year, but now I use Infura because the node is so heavy/hard to maintain and it is just easier to do it this way.
Not at all good for fast development cycles.
I have learned to embrace how slow testing can be because everything is async there.
For the raffle system I need to draw a random number, and right now this is kind of impossible in the EVM. The holy grail would be to produce a really random number at compilation time that cannot be tampered with by miners etc.
Right now I am just using an oracle to do this.

This is like Internet cash, but I’m used to forgetting my password. Fund recovery for a new user. Once you have value, you can learn about private key, about mnemonic. Funding something that makes multisig easy to use.
The cold start problem, not having them to pay the initial gas costs when they don’t have value. If you can solve those two things, mainstream adoption.
I think having a dedicated layer 2 talks specifically could be interesting. Layer 2 solutions are the solutions that scale. Get more Layer 2 solution widespread. And then a lot more collaboration between projects. Projects that need Layer 2 solutions could invest into a fund that is a common platform so not everyone does their own solution. To keep it very practical, want to incentivize everyone to share the knowledge. Could start a DAO to automate this, could get some funding via token inflation. They are working on this DAO on the side but there is still some aftermath for the DAO,. Providing this structure to have people come together on projects as opposed to one project.

All libraries, docs, interfaces, etc have ossified around the web3 API, which is basically a wrapper around a trusted RPC interface to a node, so it may as well be a client to a centralised system
Very difficult to provide good UX with ethereum ""nonce"" system: having multiple transactions in flight at once doesn't work the way people expect them to (""nonce"" is a misnomer anyway -- only way to cancel a transaction or resend with a higher gas price is to reuse a nonce, something you should never do with cryptographic nonces)
Everything is built with polling in mind, even when a push notification system would be superior. Need to poll infura constantly since you can't subscribe to events. Inefficient (wasted bandwidth/CPU) and bad UI (users aren't notified as soon as possible when something happens)
Off-chain signature APIs are inconsistent across implementations, in multiple different ways
When signing data in metamask, users see a bunch of gibberish unicode characters. Proposed solution was to make a ""good enough"" schema instead of, for example, re-using the solidity ABI
Things not directly related to consensus don't seem to be well designed: The ""sandwich"" model of complexity (where you assume someone else will come and do the hard-work of integration so you don't have to) hasn't worked great so far
Metamask silently pushes down updates to users without their consent, occasionally breaking things (and of course they could steal all your eth if they ever wanted to). They also have a built-in censorship infrastructure now (supposedly only to use against phishing sites, but potential is there for anything)
Testnets like rinkeby make you sign up with your facebook account or something to get coins

Last week, when deploying some contracts through Embark, it just read my contracts as interfaces and so didn’t compile them.
Not an Embark error - it comes from solc, because there was an error about the “stack being too deep” which happens when you have more than 16 local variables (which is not well documented anywhere that I know about).

Easy storage/uploading to Swarm and IPFS. Swarm in particular as IPFS support has been there for a long time.
Swarm has unique support for DApps and we are building some examples that use state channels and other interesting scaling solutions being developed.
These sort of example projects (well beyond SimpleStorage) allow us to put ourselves in our users’ shoes and understand what can really be done and where the pain points most often are.
Embark is planning to integrate the Remix debugger as well.
Tracking how the value associated with variable changes in the course of running specific transactions etc. is a very important feature for us.
Embark also has Whisper support, which can still be improved a lot.
Right now, we try to simplify the experience of using Whisper, but it therefore lacks some flexibility.
I am not able to specify a private key that links to a public symmetric key. E.g. when working on the gas relay node (a node-js service that subscribes to a whisper symmetric key) and we have to do it manually using the web3js library because the whisper functionality provided by Embark specifies the keys automatically and it is not currently possible to change them.
What is the gas relay node you mentioned?
It lets you perform transactions without actually holding Ether. It works by sending a signed message (through Whisper, or p2p, whatever). The signed msg is parsed by nodejs service and it will use the ETH that service has to create that transaction for you and will deduct the amount of required tokens from the account that sent the signed messaged.
It is ready to be demoed internally, but we need some additional input.
This solution needs to be included in the app, the desktop app, and perhaps even in the mailserver nodes, so requires a lot of feedback from our different teams.

The Graph is a Layer 2 protocol that sits on top of Ethereum that builds those indexes that makes all that data available via GraphQL.
GraphQL has become really popular in the web and mobile community, substantial improvement over REST API’s. Gives you flexibility so you can make changes to UI so you don’t have to make changes to the back-end. Having this query language on Ethereum is great.

",Go,Geth,,,,"Optimizing Geth:
It all started with a rough kinda experiment – in November network became congested –
Started doing profiling in Go. Learned to do it then.
Saw that geth was mostly talking with LevelDB database.
The process:
1) look at the profile
2) ask questions – why is it slow?
3) then look at code, edit, experiment to improve.
The system is complex – hundreds of goroutines running at the same time.
Trying to optimize the state management. State is constantly growing. Things will have to be written on disk; fetching it again will be slow. Can have cache, but what if it’s outside of the cache.
Problem 1) speed of processing.
Problem 2) if you’re running a full node –
Fast-sync: download all the headers + download enough state objects from other peers to only verify randomly selected blocks.
Then, after this, you become a full sync node.
Whole state from beginning is ~ 600GB.
It needs to be compressed.
How do you test your optimizations:
Peter from Geth told him: you can export the blocks, run through your node without being connected to network, and process.
Jameson Lopp:
His criteria for a blockchain: how quickly it syncs.
Idea for bounties:
Shared resource: have block data sliced up into pieces (e.g. first 100k blocks, second 100k blocks etc.), give it a Github branch, spin up the image, it does a git pull, launches an instance of the client without p2p mode, imports this part of the blockchain, does comparison across different parts (e.g. when there was a spam attack in ~2.4m block)
My goal: to go through spam blocks really quickly. Every sync should be very fast.
People complaining (e.g. exchanges) that they can’t keep up with the blockchain – e.g. Etherscan – falling behind. The clients are becoming inefficient. Instability problems. “When quantitative changes become qualitative” – breaking points are hit.
Go-ethereum developers are also working on this – I do the same – but I like not having the responsibility and just hacking around.
Collaborations between different clients: Parity & Geth
Parity had a great breakthrough – how to tune parameters of database – can sync on HDD. I’m hoping that collaborations will grow. State management across clients is important.

It’s always been “good enough” for me, even though it is improving rapidly all the time.
Issues with Infura detailed above cost me quite a bit in failed deployments, and the only way I figured it out was by having direct access to the Infura team, which others obviously won’t and that is an issue.
How deployments work with different gasPrices - it’s not clear if you should worry about things like time outs during the process. What if you set a low price, end up waiting hours, and your internet suddenly drops? What if there is a time out on the request to an API somewhere that fails?
I always default to a higher gasPrice when deploying to make sure it actually passes and is including.
Better documentation around best practices and common pitfalls here is definitely needed.
Ganache has visual interface to their test explorer. Sometimes you want something with a more visible understanding of what transpired with certain transactions. Like etherscan displaying internal transactions and well-known contract events, but with visuals.
Visual analysis/element would really help developers understand what is happening in the network.

A lot of curation market stuff: usage, governance and management of the community.
There are different interesting ideas around this. Dmitry from Ocean proposed a model where a bounty is funded collectively, then it graduates to an NFT after a certain threshold. Will go back to him for more details on this.
The usage of curved bonding for network effects on bounties: let’s say Status wants to issue a bounty. The buy Status bounty tokens on a curved bond, backed by SNT or Eth. This is valuable because, over time, if Status only uses Status bounty tokens for their bounties, you slowly build up a network effect around that token. Can either sell out or hold the tokens if you believe more people will fund more bounties in the futures. This allows people to speculate on the work being done in Status - it is a really a super-powered donation though.
It’s kind of like network effects for investment or VC.

The EVM is notoriously bad at providing good error reports.
Revert with reason will be really helpful for this. But there might still be edge cases where it is not certain what transpired.

A lot of my knowledge comes from debugging myself and following the traces through the EVM. Sometimes you just have to vasbyt (an Afrikaans word meaning, roughly, grit your teeth and just hold on).
Solidity is moving more towards safer defaults in general, which allows more advanced devs to take the guard rails off when we know what we are doing:
Explicitly setting the constructor (to avoid some of the Parity hacks)
Addition of transfer function to automatically check for failure of sends (which was previously manual).
After DAO hack, I started collecting information and Smart Contract best practices repo, which is now maintained by the Consensys Diligence team.
Infura uses a load balancer between multiple Eth clients, but these have different tx pools, so during the migration process, it is pinging infura, but it is shuffling the request to different node each time, which eventually cause the migration to fail.
However, the error reporting from the client claims that the nonce is too low, which is technically true, but not at all descriptive about why the migration actually failed.

Having a financial reward can actually hinder people if the work is creative. Only really helps when there are pretty clear guidelines and it is more a problem with motivation.

﻿William Entriken,"Started using Ethereum in December.
Created ERC721/161 to support my project. It was contentious, I won the fork wars.
Underestimated how crazy this ERC721 process was.
721 is the first standard that’s actually an Interface.
Interfaces are broken in Solidity.
Started filling bugs in Solidity. –– interfaces should be able to inherit from interfaces.
External vs public in interfaces. I fixed it.
Fixing things in Solidity –– basically rewriting the whole inheritance model in Solidity.
In 721, I had a caveat section, “errors in Solidity etc” ––
People said: “the standard shouldn’t say a function is payable” –– but I said that the interface needs to enforce this.
Got the attention of Christian, Alex, Hudson.
721 had a dependency on 165. So I started to fix 165.
Mainly occupied with full time job, speaking re: 721 and its use cases at conferences, evangelism, million dollar homepage, navy, google, hardware (semiconductors)

The ERC process:
Bring initiative, there’s forks, solve the problems –– being polite, being political, making phone calls to reach consensus.
Problems:
Problem #1: Ethereum is centralized. Code / governance is handled by one party.
This is the “EIP” process.
These aren’t technical reasons, they’re political reasons.
The EIP process:
Anybody writes an EIP – must be technically valid, describes a change to the Ethereum ecosystem. “I want a sidechain”, “i want to change the gas for this opcode”, etc
If the EIP is implementable (i.e. it compiles), it’s accepted as a draft.
If there is community support, it’ll be reviewed by all core devs.
If it is supported by core devs, it is implemented.
If people support it, then people will upgrade the clients.
How it actually works:
You publish the EIP. There is a storm of discussion; emotional, backhanded.
Blackballed for mentioning cultural/political taboos
PR is not the right word for it. More like a wiki.
They discuss it at the core dev meeting. They implement the code, clients upgrade it.
Someone puts it on Hudson’s PM meeting agenda
How Swift (from Apple) handles this:
You go to the mailing lists, you start a discussion.
This takes a lot of effort, so you wanna be sure your stuff is legit.
Big discussion in the community. Swift is centralized (one party). You need code already, a test case or something, you explain technically in-depth. You get it to review, 2 week review period, it’s posted on top of Apple Swift website + goes out to mailing list.
The key point is: the 2 week speed pump. Everyone has to pass through that.
How DARPA handles bounties
Here’s a very specific problem and you need a 100x improvement
Come up with working solution that can support network of 10k
If you can do it elegantly, here’s 50k and we’ll study it further before implementing
The community expects full-time people; they don’t cater to part-time contributors.
A contributor needs to look at all issues and PRs –– there’s no queueing system. One could get approved at any time.
The ERC process:
Write an interface for a contract. He wrote 165 and 721.
A ton of new token standards.
First mover advantage to writing standards/interfaces - something like street cred for devs.
Over-standardization occuring
Not enough focus on what people would actually want/need to use
I don’t see the need for a package manager, the existing tools seem adequate.

﻿Facu Spagnuolo,"I studied Computer Engineering and am a full stack dev. I started my career by programming web stuff and distributed systems.
A year ago I had heard a lot about BTC and “blockchain”, so I got involved.
My life goal is to build the technologies that will make people’s lives easier and more free.
Cryptocurrencies clearly can do this, but Ethereum specifically - because of the community, and the fully functional VM on a chain - is clearly the best platform we have so far.
I knew Manuel from before, and so got together with him and decided to start building some tutorials and interaction guides to walk people through the same forests I was exploring. Started contributing to Zeppelin as a security researcher, because that is the major focus at the company.
This gave a lot of background as I really had to grasp how thing happen in the EVM. You have to be incredibly conscious and attentive about the stuff you’re programming.
Auditing well-known projects also really helped me grow my knowledge of how the whole ecosystems works and what the best practices are.
I am now building Zeppelin OS - upgradable smart contracts, with a scheduler, and on chain standard libraries.
It’s a huge challenge to build this on Ethereum currently, so I became a core member and we are releasing our first version today!!
","security, research, education, community, audit, ecosystem","Bitcoin, Ethereum, Open Zeppelin, EVM","Speed of testing in Truffle is taking ~15min and it should be 1-2 at most. We need to speed that cycle up badly.
Ropsten is really slow when we need to test something in a “real” network. We have needed to cancel manually our own transactions and follow many rabbits down many different holes to figure out what happened. We need a better, more realistic testnet, for all our contracts.
You can’t set breakpoints when debugging contracts, or end-to-end transactions on the network and this can cause you to lose the whole day when you miss something as simple as a flag or a param in a contract etc.
No easy way to log things in Solidity, which makes missing the stuff above much easier than it should be.
The linter tools also take too long. It should just be possible to install and run these sorts of things without needing to do any config of your own, which is not currently the case.
Solcoverage has to be set up manually, and the docs kind of suck around this. It took us a long time to figure it all out for ourselves.
Plain solidity console/interpreter to test your contracts where you can play with the types, variables and scopes without needing to recompile everything.
Volatility of the markets - really hard to convince people to join and use the currency because of this.
Legal issues around launching companies and products are a real PITA. We need proper DAOs and soon.
Came out of web dev industry, and it is really mature. They have a lot of methodologies for running projects and organising teams. Most people in Ethereum are very young and these sort of processes are generally a mess.
There’s a lot of pressure on the back of the price, and this or that ICO and we need to make sure that the community supports and contributes to better, clearer, slower processes that actually achieve the desired goals rather than cutting corners to ship not-really-decentralized products.
We need to figure out some new processes too unique to the problems we face in crypto.

We are still exploring which models are better for upgradeability. How to take into account the community, dev team, investors etc. We need a governance pattern that works specifically for upgradeability decisions, which tend to be more focussed than larger governance questions and might lend themselves to specific, narrow mechanisms.
It may be possible to modify the way the compiler maps state variable to storage, so that we can allow people to implement similar patterns to ours without all the inline assembly stuff. Might make a nice bounty - improving the compiler in general to allow new features specifically in terms of what you can do with the EVM.
Having a scheduler implies huge gas costs, so we need to find scheduling mechanisms that will allow the community to run transactions in a feature for you and be rewarded with tokens or Eth or whatever. (see chronologic for this kind of stuff too)
We are trying to see if there is anyway to use TCRs and token curation markets in order to handle on chain standard libraries and upgradeability too. The idea behind zeppelin OS is to encourage other teams to build their own on chain standard libraries and provide them through zeppelin OS to be used in other projects. We would love to see the community come forward with suggestions about how this could be best managed.

We can improve a lot of things here and build some more things on top of it.
Testing your contracts easily across any network and setting your own defaults through the console is not as easy as it should be.
Truffle scripts allow you to deploy your application, but the truffle environment itself is very difficult to manage, especially if you need to modify it to fit your specific project. You can lose days trying to do that.
We should start thinking about providing an interface that can be consumed, extended and used by other cmd line tools, and things like zeppelin_OS.
The testing environment is really good, but could still provide some extra features (like better debugging and changing variable easily between tests without needing to recompile everything).
I haven’t yet found one chance to run the debugger properly - but we really need that and it really needs to be easy to use.
When I try to debug my contracts on the network, I start logging events on the smart contract to see what is happening. This is really slow, it is a waste of gas and is not the way I want to handle things in the future.
We also use open zeppelin a lot in our own projects: i.e. DApps we build ourselves, and zeppelin_OS - an on chain version that can be used as a standard library for zeppelin OS.
Currently you have to deploy manually the smart contracts from our libraries that you want to use. But now, with zeppelin_OS, everyone can build a standard library that can be linked to a project that is using zeppelin_OS and everyone can use the same source code.
Say goodbye to all those deploy-time issues ;)
We use many small helper libraries: e.g. to do tricky things like testing low level calls, crafted transactions where you need to specify very small things to do with the data as an array of byte or whatever. Truffle provides no friendly way to do this, so you have to start playing with buffers of bytes and hashes and all sorts of nonsense.
Ethereumjs-abi, ethereumjs-utils etc.
Web3 is a great library. It’s very simple, though it’s been a long time that they have been promising a stable 1.0 version.
MetaMask is also really useful - makes life easier in so many ways.
We use both geth and parity as we have our own nodes to test things.
Remix is really cool and it works really well. I encourage people to use it and look forward to new releases from them.

We’ve been exploring many different approaches over the last year, all of them using proxies: i.e a contract using a delegateCall opcode to make things happen.
Biggest problem: we had to store information about 2 different domains, 1 of them being the proxy information and the other the contract that needs to be upgraded.
Proxy information: delegates each call to implementation contract. Storage in proxy contract, logic elsewhere, so not something new (Parity also uses this pattern).
We don’t see how upgradability works without some kind of mechanism for governance: the proxy needs to ask someone/something if the contract can/should be upgraded. This information needs to be stored as well: the “owner” and the implementation details.
The way solidity manages storage, the contract that was going to be upgraded needed to follow the storage slots where the proxy was saving the relevant information because it is important not to overwrite them.
We found a final approach that manages this very elegantly: using inline assembly to store variable and bypass the way solidity performs its own checks. We are using storage slots that solidity will never be able to access, which is how we can ensure our approaches are really safe and that we can have upgradeable smart contracts that don’t overwrite important information.
Why should we even have upgradeable though, if immutability is such a big thing?
We really don’t think upgradeability works without governance.
We have storage in one place and logic in another. So the storage actually remains immutable and will never forget what is put into it. We can modify it, but that is part of the history and you can inspect those modifications easily if you like.
We are not leaving immutability then, just handling it in a smarter way.
The idea came from exploring the strategy Solidity itself uses for mapping of variables, but with some delta to make sure Solidity won’t overwrite things.

Would be great if there were a single command to run all the tests.
How do I run a single (VM) test easily? Or even just an arbitrary subset of tests? We use CI tools to run them instead (Travis, but are transitioning to Circle). It’s all dockerized, so getting tests to run locally is very difficult.
There is a tool called testeth, built in cpp-ethereum.
Test tooling should be in its own repo! Not maintained very well either.
In order to run testeth, I have to download and compile cpp-ethereum.
Worth having CI as its own separate point as it is the other biggest headache, along with testing.
Communication tools in the EWASM team - use gitter currently. No threading, images etc, basic stuff that is missing.
EF uses Discord internally and there is an #ewasm channel there, but we have team members who are not part of the Ethereum Foundation and are not on Discord so we need another channel.
Setting up bridges is a possible solution that seems to be working quite well for other teams.
Testeth is a great place for bounties and should NOT BE A PART of cpp-ethereum
Getting testnets up and running - there should be a test network in a box that we can just deploy at the press of the button It should not require a  devops engineer to handle this kind of stuff.
There is a half-baked interpreter for WASM in Go and C++, but we need one in python so that we can plug into Trinity (the new Python full node implementation that is being written from scratch and is the vehicle for research including sharding).

Do you know who your users are? What sort of feedback loops do you have with them? How do you talk with them? Have you done user needs analysis?
Communication tools are interesting to dive deeper into - both internal and external.
Governance and signals is very important to me - how do you get a sense for community consensus? Build things that reflect the collective will of the community, but we don’t have access to that. What signals would you like to be able to get from your community and how?
Concept in medicine called “practicing at the top of your degree” - doctors should not be scheduling or handling payments. Devs shouldn’t be worried about devops, finances, scheduling.
What % of your time today are you spending practicing at the top of your degree/qualification? Talk about processes especially.

","community, identity","Ethereum, uPort","Personally, I don’t have that many frustrations. However, Solidity has a lot of updates every time and has a lot of breaking changes. It’s difficult to manage this. EthPM will help this.
As a team, working distributed on a lot of systems that are new is pretty tough. But have a pretty knowledgeable team.
Still deal a lot with the JavaScript ecosystem. Heard web3js was garbage, not having promises and heard it wasn’t great. Heard Ethers.js was good, supported by Richard Moore of the Ethereum Foundation. Would be great to have education that there are other options out there beyond the most popular projects
Eth.js from Nick Dodson is super bare bones and super modular, Ethers.js is a bit more built out by Richard Moore.
I dibble dabble in smart contracts, I do a few demos with things like token staking for events. But I am mainly in the web 2 stuff. Not necessarily building out infrastructure or production ready contracts, more of showing the general web3 flow.
Would recommend to redo Remix, want to share code from Remix. From Remix, be able to push GitHub. More of a collaborative Remix, better UI.

They’ve taken a big focus on not just focusing on the code but focusing on the experience. Not good to throw encyclopedias at people. Truffle sits in the middle, they have good docs. Ethereum itself is pretty difficult to parse their docs.
Designing for intermediate JavaScript developers could be very interesting. Catering this education experience better.
Just looked at smart contracts long enough, wasn’t super intimidating as they are designed to be simple. Looking at Zeppelin, looking at best practices, understanding this stuff. But now want to get more into bytecode stuff.
Lack lower level knowledge of how to super optimize a smart contract. Want more code to look at to get at optimizing bytecode.

Getting away from smart contracts, looking at a different identity protocol layer. If uPort was continuing in smart contracts  upgradeability via smart contracts (ZeppelinOS) would be interesting.
Deprecating our smart contracts, but using ether-did (decentralization identity). Just need a private key and a public key, so don’t need a smart contract. Etherdid registry is a smart contract, but smart contracts are not the core protocol any more.
